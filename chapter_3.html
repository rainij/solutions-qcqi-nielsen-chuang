<p>
In this section we define a class <code>TuringMachine</code> which empowers us to execute a turing program like
this one:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org7c78cc3">
# This program computes the function f(n)=1.
# Example: input="▶1001", output="▶1".
(S,▶,A,▶,+) # S is the start state
(A,0,A,■,+)
(A,1,A,■,+)
(A,■,B,■,-)
(B,■,B,■,-)
(B,▶,C,▶,+)
(C,■,H,1,0) # H is the halt state
</pre>

<p>
Below we initialize a Turing machine <code>my_tm</code> from the above source code:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python" id="org5298d76"><span class="org-variable-name">my_tm</span> <span class="org-operator">=</span> TuringMachine.fromSource(source, start_state<span class="org-operator">=</span><span class="org-string">"S"</span>, halt_state<span class="org-operator">=</span><span class="org-string">"H"</span>)

my_tm.<span class="org-variable-name">COLORED_LOG</span> <span class="org-operator">=</span> <span class="org-constant">False</span>  <span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">set to false since listing below does not support colors</span>

<span class="org-variable-name">result</span> <span class="org-operator">=</span> my_tm.run(<span class="org-string">"&#9654;0"</span>)
<span class="org-builtin">print</span>(f<span class="org-string">"</span><span class="org-constant">\n</span><span class="org-string">result = '</span>{result}<span class="org-string">'"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Setting <code>LOG_LEVEL=3</code> makes the Turing machine print certain informations for each step of
execution. The result can be seen in the following listing (with <code>COLORED_LOG=True</code> this would be
even more informative). Note that in theory the tape is infinite. We realize this by dynamically
allocating new blank cells whenever we want to access a cell not already allocated (we roughly
double the tape size in that case).
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org12812ea">

Executing step 1
tape = '▶0'
state='S', symbol='▶', head_position=0
source line = 2: (S,▶,A,▶,+) # S is the start state

Executing step 2
tape = '▶0'
state='A', symbol='0', head_position=1
source line = 3: (A,0,A,■,+)

Executing step 3
tape = '▶■■■■'
state='A', symbol='■', head_position=2
source line = 5: (A,■,B,■,-)

Executing step 4
tape = '▶■■■■'
state='B', symbol='■', head_position=1
source line = 6: (B,■,B,■,-)

Executing step 5
tape = '▶■■■■'
state='B', symbol='▶', head_position=0
source line = 7: (B,▶,C,▶,+)

Executing step 6
tape = '▶■■■■'
state='C', symbol='■', head_position=1
source line = 8: (C,■,H,1,0) # H is the halt state

Execution took 6 steps.

result = '▶1'

<p>
First we introduce some useful types. We represent the state by strings since this <i>allows</i> for
readable or at least mnemonic state names. This would not be possible had we used integers. The
<code>SourceMap</code> is responsible for connecting each parsed line of the turing program with its original
from the source-string/file. It is the reason why in the <a href="#org12812ea">listing above</a> the <code>TuringMachine</code> instance
can refer to its source (see the line starting with <code>source line =</code>).

<p>
<a href="#orgeb21f80">Below</a> follows the implementation of the <code>TuringMachine</code>. The logging functionality bloats the
implementation a bit. But it you ignore this the implementation is very simple and straightforward
to understand (IMHO).
</p>

<p>
Note that the <code>__init__</code> method takes the program as an already parsed list of tuples
(<code>TuringProgram</code>). The canonical way to create a <code>TuringMachine</code> is to use the <code>fromSource</code> factory
method. Among other things you can optionally provide a custom parser. This might be beneficial to
introduce syntactic sugar. For example the code snippit
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org89fe23b">
(a,0,a,0,+)
(a,1,a,1,+)
(a,2,a,2,+)
(a,3,a,3,+)
(a,4,a,4,+)
(a,5,a,5,+)
</pre>

<p>
might seem somewhat verbose. Probably this would be nicer syntax:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orga265e18">
(a,0|1|2|3|4|5,a,$,+)  # "$" meaning: take the original
# or even (if this is the intended meaning)
(a,*,a,$,+)  # "*" meaning: match all
</pre>

<p>
Another reason to use a custom parser would be to circumvent some restrictions of the default
parser. For example the default parser treats the symbols <code>#</code>, <code>,</code>, <code>(</code>, <code>)</code> in a special way. In
particular, those cannot be used as characters on the tape.

<p>
Show that single-tape Turing machines can each be given a number from the list \(1,2,3,\ldots\) in
such a way that the number uniquely specifies the corresponding machine. We call this number the
Turing number of the corresponding Turing machine. (<i>Hint</i>: Every positive integer has a unique
prime factorization \(p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}\), where \(p_i\) are distinct prime numbers,
and \(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k\) are non-negative integers.)

<div id="outline-container-org0b1da0d" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0b1da0d">Proof</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0b1da0d">
<p>
For simplicity we assume that the state space and the alphabet are fixed for all Turing machines we
consider (one could easily relax this constraint without complicating the encoding). Hence we need
to encode the start state, the halt state and the program into a single number. This is sufficient
to describe the Turing Machine. We follow the proposal to use prime numbers for that. Therefore let
us enumerate the prime numbers starting by \(2\): \(p_1=2\), \(p_2=3\), &#x2026;, \(p_5=11\), &#x2026; .
</p>

<p>
This procedure is certainly not the most efficient one but it serves the purpose to show that all
Turing machines (satsifying a specific definition/architecture) can be <i>effectively</i>
enumerated. That is, there is an <i>algorithm</i> (which could potentially run on a Turing machine),
which assigns numbers to each Turing machine. Moreover this assignment is invertible and the inverse
mapping (numbers to Turing machines) can be computed by an <i>algorithm</i> too.
</p>

<p>
Let us identify the states \(S\) and the elements of the alphabet \(\Gamma\) with integers:
</p>

<p>
\[
  S = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\} ; \quad \Gamma = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Moreover, we encode the possible movements by \(\{0,1,2\}\), meaning <i>left</i>, <i>stay</i>, <i>right</i> in that
order. We encode the start state \(s\in\NN\) and the halt state \(h\in\NN\) by
</p>

<p>
\[
  p_1^s \text{ and } p_2^h .
\]
</p>

<p>
The \(i\)​-th program line
</p>

<p>
\[
  (q_i,c_i,q'_i,c'_i,m_i) \in \NN^4\times\{0,1,2\}
\]
</p>

<p>
can be encoded by
</p>

<p>
\[
  l_i = p_{5i+3}^{q_i} \, p_{5i+4}^{c_i} \, p_{5i+5}^{q'_i} \, p_{5i+6}^{c'_i} \, p_{5i+7}^{m_i} .
\]
</p>

<p>
The whole program is then encoded by the product \(\Pi_il_i\) and the Turing machine itself by
\(p_1^s\,p_2^h\,\Pi_il_i\). Since prime factorization of integers is unique, this encoding is
invertible and hence the Turing machine can be recovered from this (potentially large) number. QED.

<h3 id="org4f233d1">Exercise 3.3 (Turing machine to reverse a bit string)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4f233d1">
<p>
Describe a Turing machine which takes a binary number \(x\) as input, and outputs the bits of \(x\) in
reverse order. (Hint: In this exercise and the next it may help to use a multi-tape Turing machine
and/or symbols other than ▶, 0, 1, and the blank.)
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1c70806" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1c70806">Solution</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1c70806">
<p>
We use a single tape together with and additional symbol "□", which we call <i>white blank</i> in the
following.
</p>

<p>
Assume that the input tape starts with the left-end-marker "▶" followed by the number \(x\) in
binary. All other cells should be blank. As an example, for \(x=13\) the input tape should look like
that:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org1f2866d">
┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬
│ ▶ │ 1 │ 1 │ 0 │ 1 │   │   │   │   │   │ ...
└───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴
</pre>

<p>
Note that the empty tape is not allowed - there should always be at least one digit. The Turing
machine should halt with only the reversed bitstring at the beginning of the tape. In the example
above:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org9dd9065">
┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬
│ ▶ │ 1 │ 0 │ 1 │ 1 │   │   │   │   │   │ ...
└───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴
</pre>

<p>
The idea of the algorithm is as follows (the white blanks <code>□</code> simplify the implementation):
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>1. Reverse the string, but shifted</dt><dd><code>▶1011■■■■■</code> → <code>▶□□□□1101■</code></dd>
<dt>2. Shift the reversed string to the correct position</dt><dd><code>▶□□□□1101■</code> → <code>▶1101□□□□■</code></dd>
<dt>3. Remove trailing white blanks</dt><dd><code>▶1101□□□□■</code> → <code>▶1101■■■■■</code></dd>
</dl>

<p>
Step-by-step the first part does the following. What we call <i>step</i> is actually several steps for
the Turing machine (since the head can only move by one position at a time). We remark already here
that the last displayed cell, containing a blank (always), is very important as an end-marker for
the second step of the algorithm.
</p>

└───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴
</pre>

<p>
The second part of the algorithm does this:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgdd7e698">

│ ▶ │ □ │ □ │ □ │ □ │ 1 │ 0 │ 1 │ 1 │   │ ...

<p>
In the following we present a <a href="#org1d0997a">Turing program</a> which does exactly this. Don't worry, most of the
program is just comments - explaining how it works, and at the same time giving a kind of
<i>inline-proof</i> that the program is correct in the sense that it "does what we want".
</p>

<p>
To best understand the inline-proof read the following explanations:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The program consists of set of source <i>blocks</i> - kind of subroutines of the program.</li>
<li>Each block is a sequence of program lines without any intermediate <i>empty lines</i> (line comments
are OK).</li>
<li>Each block has one or more <i>entry</i> lines (marked by a comment <code># entry</code>). If a block is entered we
require that we start at one of these lines - everything else is considered an error (does not
happen if the program as a whole is correct).</li>
<li>Each block has one ore more <i>exit</i> lines (marked by a comment <code># exit</code>). Each block must guarantee
that upon entering another block (or halting) we do this via one of these lines.</li>
<li>Each block has <i>pre-conditions</i>. These are sets of statements that we require to hold immediately
before the first line of the block is executed (each time a block is "called"). If we enter a
block but the pre-conditions do not hold we call this <i>undefined behavior</i>. We require that our
program never runs into undefined behavior.</li>
<li>Each block has <i>post-conditions</i>. These are sets of statements that we require to hold immediately
after we "return" from the block. The block must ensure that these statements hold.</li>
<li>Each block has zero or more <i>successor blocks</i>. Upon exiting the block it is guaranteed that we
must enter one if these successor blocks. This info helps navigating the code, since there are
usually only very few succesor blocks for each block.</li>
</ul>

# Turing program to reverse a string of bits (0s and 1s):
#   - input  : "▶a...z■..." where a...z is a string of 0s and 1s

# the analysis of the *generic* case. But it is easy to check that this corner case
# also works. This is more or less an accident as you can see by the fact that we rely
# on the fact that (by our definition) a Turing machine halts if no matching line is
# found.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6825805">
<p>
Describe a Turing machine to add two binary numbers \(x\) and \(y\) modulo 2. The numbers are
input on the Turing machine tape in binary, in the form \(x\), followed by a single blank,
followed by a \(y\). If one number is not as long as the other then you may assume that it
has been padded with leading 0s to make the two numbers the same length.

<h4 id="org2c634f6">Solution</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2c634f6">
<p>
The idea of the <a href="#org7dda01d">program</a> can be seen in the following example, adding <code>x=000</code> and <code>y=111</code>.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>1. prepare input</dt><dd><code>▶00■11■■</code> → <code>▶00□11□■</code></dd>
<dt>2. update x inplace</dt><dd><ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>▶00□11□■</code> → <code>▶■0□11□■</code> → <code>▶■0□□1□■</code> → <code>▶10□□1□■</code></li>
<li><code>▶10□□1□■</code> → <code>▶1■□□1□■</code> → <code>▶1■□□□□■</code> → <code>▶11□□□□■</code></li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>3. cleanup and halt</dt><dd><code>▶11□□□□■</code> → <code>▶11■■■■■</code></dd>
</dl>

<p>
In the first stage we replace the blank cell in the gap between \(x\) and \(y\) and the cell
after \(y\) by a white blank. This simplifies the Turing program. In the first step of the
second stage we memorize the first bit of \(x\) (a zero <code>0</code> here) and go to the right until
we find the first bit of \(y\). We add this to our memorized bit of \(x\), replace it by a
white blank and transport back the result to the marked location (the blank). Now we
repeat the procedure with the next bit - and so on. Finally we have to replace the white
blanks by ordinary blanks and move the head back to the beginning.

<p>
This problem can easily be reduced the version of the halting problem from Box 3.2. In
fact, for any turing machine \(M\) (expressed in terms of its program) we consider the
turing machine \(M'\) which first writes the Turing number of \(M\) to the tape and then
proceeds as \(M\).
</p>

<p>
Note that the mapping \(M\mapsto M'\) can be effectively computed (by an algorithm). But we
do not need this fact here - just nice to know.
</p>

<p>
Clearly \(M'\) halts upon the empty tape iff \(M\) halts upon its Turing number being on the
tape. Hence, this variant of the halting problem can not be computed effectively
either. QED.

Suppose we number the probabilistic Turing machines using a scheme similar to that found
in Exercise 3.2 and define the probabilistic halting function \(h_p(x)\) to be \(1\) if
machine \(x\) halts on input of \(x\) with probability at least \(1/2\) and \(0\) if machine \(x\)

probabilistic Turing machine which can output \(h_p(x)\) with probability of correctness

<h4 id="org11f2cb0">Proof</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org11f2cb0">
<p>
The reasoning from Box 3.2 applies here too.
</p>

<p>
Assume that there is a Turing machine <code>HALT</code> which, for all inputs \(x\), halts and returns
\(h_p(x)\) with probability \(p_x>1/2\). This implies that with probability <i>at most</i>
\(1-p_x<1/2\) it returns the wrong result or does not halt.
</p>

<p>
Define <code>TURING</code> in the same way as in Box 3.2 and let \(t\) be its Turing number. If
\(h_p(t)=1\) we have <code>y=HALT(t)</code> with probability \(p_t>1/2\). But the latter means that
<code>TURING(t)</code> loops forever with a probability \(p_t>1/2\) which implies \(h_p(t)=0\) -
contradiction. On the other hand \(h_p(t)=0\) also leads to a contradiction. QED.

Suppose a black box is made available to us which takes a non-negative integer \(x\) as
input, and then outputs the value of \(h(x)\), where \(h\) is the halting function defined in
Box 3.2. This type of black box is sometimes known as an <i>oracle</i> for the halting
problem. Suppose we have a regular Turing machine which is augmented by the power to call
the oracle. One way of accomplishing this is to use a two-tape Turing machine, and add an
extra program instruction to the Turing machine which results in the oracle being called,
and the value of \(h(x)\) being printed on the second tape, where \(x\) is the current
contents of the second tape. It is clear that this model for computation is more powerful
than the conventional Turing machine model, since it can be used to compute the halting
function. Is the halting problem for this model of computation undecidable? That is, can a
Turing machine aided by an oracle for the halting problem decide whether a program for the
Turing machine with oracle will halt on a particular input?

<h4 id="org8bc59ad">Solution</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8bc59ad">
<p>
This follows directly from the argument in Box 3.2. In fact, the argument does not impose
any restrictions on the model of computation except that at least <i>some</i> things are
possible. So the answer is <i>no</i>. There is no such algorithm in this enhanced model of
computation. More generally, any enhancements of the "usual" model of computation (in
terms of added oracles which compute certain previously uncomputable functions) does
suffer from the lack of a halting algorithm (implementable inside the model itself).
</p>

<p>
On the other hand <i>weak</i> models of computation may allow the existence of a halting
algorithm. Particularly simple is the case of a programming language which just has
branching (<code>if ... then ... else ... end</code>) as the only control structure (in particular no
loops). In that case, any algorithm halts and the halting algorithm can be implemented in
a trivial way.

Suppose an \(n\) element list is sorted by applying some sequence of compare-and-swap
operations to the list. There are \(n!\) possible initial orderings of the list. Show that
after \(k\) of the compare-and-swap operations have been applied, at most \(2^k\) of the
possible initial orderings will have been sorted into the correct order. Conclude that
\(\Omega(n\log(n))\) compare-and-swap operations are required to sort all possible initial
orderings into the correct order.

<h4 id="orgf845123">Proof</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf845123">
<p>
First, let us note that starting from an orderd sequence of numbers, like \(1,2,\ldots,n\)
applying at most \(k\) compare-and-swap operations we can generate at most \(2^k\)
sequences. From this statement easily follows the first part of the exercise since sorting
is just the reverse of this "shuffling-procedure".
</p>

<p>
In fact, we can see this by mathematical induction:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>case \(k=0\)</dt><dd>Clearly we generate <i>exactly</i> one sequence in that case.</dd>
<dt>induction step \(k+1\leftarrow k\)</dt><dd>Assume the statement holds for \(k\) and consider
\(k+1\). We know that after <i>at most</i> \(k\) steps we get at most \(2^k\) sequences. If we
<i>optionally</i> add another step we can at most double that number!</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This proves the first part. Therefore, to be able to sort all \(n!\) permutations we need at
least a number \(k_n\) of steps which necessarily satisfies
</p>

<p>
\[
  2^{k_n} \geq n! .
\]
</p>

<p>
By a <i>very weak</i> version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation">Stirlings Formula</a> we have
</p>

<p>
\[
  \log(n!) = \Omega(n\log(n)) .
\]
</p>

<p>
By taking the logarithm of the first inequality and plugging in the second inequality we
get \(k_n=\Omega(n\log(n))\). QED.
</p>

<p>
Just for completeness, here is a short proof of the our very weak Stirling-type
inequality:
</p>

<p>
\[
  \log(n!) = \sum_{k=1}^n \log(k) \geq \sum_{k > n/e} \log(k)
  \geq (n-\lfloor ne^{-1} \rfloor)(\log(n) - 1)
  = \Omega(n\log(n)) .
\]
</p>

<p>
Note that \(\log(n!)\leq n\log(n)\) is even easier to see. Hence we actually have proven
that \(\log(n!)=\Theta(n\log(n))\).

<p>
To be specific we assume that the circuits consist of <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>, and <code>NOT</code>
gates. Moreover we allow arbitrary many <code>FANOUT</code> operations.
</p>

<p>
The proof relies on the first two of the following lemmas. To avoid irrelevant corner
cases we assume \(k\geq n\).
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The number of boolean functions on \(n\) inputs is \(2^{2^n}\).</li>

circuit using at most \(O(k^2)\) <code>FANOUT</code> which computes the same boolean function.</li>

<h5 id="orge0112f1">Proof of 1</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orge0112f1">
<p>
The number of \(n\) bit numbers is \(2^n\) (a factor of two for each bit). For each of the

\(2^{(2^n)}\) possibilities in total. QED.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgcd9228b">
<p>
Conider an arbitrary circuit. Let us define the <i>spec</i> of the circuit as follows: For each
of the \(k\) gates specify the type as being <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>, or <code>NOT</code>. This makes for \(3^k\)
possibilities. For each of the <i>at most</i> \(2k\) inputs to all the gates specify to which
other gate or original input they are connected. If the input comes over one or more
<code>FANOUT</code> operations trace it back to the original gate where the input originates
from. With our choice of gates (and \(k\geq n\)) this makes for at most
\((k+n)^{2k}\leq(2k)^{2k}\) possibilities (at most \(2k\) inputs (at most two for each gate)
and \(k+n\) positions to connect with).
</p>

<p>
Note that each of our gates only has one output which we use here to simplify things but
this is not really crucial. If there were gates with more than one output we would also
specify which of the outputs is connected to which input of the next gate.
</p>

<p>
In total there are at most \(3^k(2k)^{2k}\leq(6k)^{2k}\) possible specs. Note that two
circuits with the same spec are guaranteed to compute the same functions. QED.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6923765">
<p>
The purpose of <code>FANOUT</code> operation is to copy either some of the inputs or some of the
intermediate outputs of the gates. In that way different gates can share the same inputs
(or one gate can obtain two versions of the same bit).
</p>

<p>
There are only \(O(k)\) bits to copy (all \(n\) inputs and all the outputs of the \(O(k)\) gates
together). Moreover, there are only \(O(k)\) destinations to copy to (all inputs of all the
\(k\) gate). Hence the number of <i>actually</i> required <code>FANOUT</code> operation is at most
\(O(k\,\cdot\,k)=O(k^2)\). QED

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgd87eb3f">
<p>
Assume that \(l=l(n)\) is the minimal number of gates needed to implement any Boolean
function on \(n\) bits. By 1 and 2 we necessarily have
</p>

<p>
\[
  (6l)^{2l} \geq 2^{2^n} .

</p>

<p>
The careful reader might notice that we assumed \(k\geq n\) in 1 and 2. This was just used
to simplify some constants. And indeed the reasoning here shows that \(k=n\) gates are not
sufficient to generate all Boolean functions. Hence there is no problem. From the last
equation we deduce \(2l\log_2(6l)\geq2^n\). Hence:
</p>

<p>
\[
  l \geq \frac{2^n}{2\log_2(6l)} = \frac{2^n}{2\log_2(6\cdot 2^n/(2\log_2(6l)))}

<h4 id="orgb1d79a4">Proof of the reverse inequality</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb1d79a4">
<p>
It can be shown that the bound is sharp up to a constant factor. That is, all functions
can be implemented by \(O(2^n/n)\) gates. This proves that the uncorrected exercise was
indeed wrong. Let us prove this now.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Any circuit can be implemented by \(O(2^n)\) gates.</li>
<li>There is a circuit with \(O(2^{2^n})\) gates which implements a function
\(f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^{2^{2^n}}\) which returns the result of <i>any</i> Boolean function at
the same time.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first version is a weaker version of what we want to prove. Actually we do not
directly apply this Lemma. Instead we just use it to demonstrate special case of a
slightly more involved construction later on.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org00df16f" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org00df16f">Proof of 1</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org00df16f">
<p>
The proof is based on the identity:
</p>

<p>
\[
  f(x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}) = \underbrace{f(x_1,\ldots,x_n,0)}_{=:f_0(\ldots)} x_{n+1}' +
  \underbrace{f(x_1,\ldots,x_n,1)}_{=:f_1(\ldots)} x_{n+1}
\]
</p>

<p>
Here we use \(+\) as "or" and multiplication as "and". The prime denotes negation. Note that
this is exactly the idea behind Figure 3.8 from the book (the <code>XOR</code> there could be a <code>OR</code>).
</p>

<p>
Apart from the circuits implementing the two functions we only need five additional gates
to implement \(f\). Hence, denoting \(c_n\) the (minimal) number of gates needed to implement
any Boolean function:
</p>

<p>
\[
  c_{n+1} \leq 2c_n + 5 .
\]
</p>

By mathematical induction we get \(c_n=O(2^n)\).

<div id="outline-container-org2fcf969" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org2fcf969">Proof of 2</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org2fcf969">
<p>
The idea of the proof is essentially based on the same formula as for Lemma 1. Let \(d_n\)
be the minimal number of gates needed. Any Boolean function \(f\) in \(n+1\) variables can be
implemented in the following way:
</p>

<p>
\[
  f(x_1,\ldots,x_n,x_{n+1}) = f_0(x_1,\ldots,x_n)x_{n+1}' + f_1(x_1,\ldots,x_n)x_{n+1} ,
\]
</p>

<p>
where each of the two functions \(f_0\) and \(f_1\) can be chosen from \(2^{2^n}\)
possibilities. From this we see
</p>

<p>
\[
  d_{n+1} \leq d_n + 3\cdot 2^{2^n} .
\]
</p>

<p>
The circuit for \(n+1\) basically consists of the circuit for \(n\) where each pair of the
\(2^{2^n}\) outputs is recombined to the new \(2^{2^{n+1}}\) outputs. Each pair uses only two
<code>AND</code> and one <code>OR</code> gates. <i>Overall</i> there is a <i>single</i> <code>NOT</code> gate needed which can be
copied around by <code>FANOUT</code> as often as we need it.
</p>

<p>
From the inequality it is easy to see by induction that \(d_n=O(2^{2^n})\).

<h5 id="orge91e9cd">Conclusion</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orge91e9cd">
<p>
The idea is as follows: The construction from Lemma 1 is already close to what we
want. The circuit in Lemma 2 despite using a lot of gates has a very good <i>average</i> gate
usage. In fact, only constantly many gates are used for each Boolean function on average!
We try to combine the two approaches to push down the upper bound obtained in Lemma 1.
</p>

<p>
Let \(m\leq n\) and write \(x=(y,z)\) where \(x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) and \(y\) and \(z\) contain the first
\(n-m\) and last \(m\) bits. Any Boolean function can be written as:
</p>

<p>
\[
  f(x) = \sum_{c\in\{0,1\}^{n-m}} y^c g_c(z) .
\]
</p>

<p>
Here \(y^c\) is a product of the bits in \(y\) where some of the bits are negated depending on
whether \(c_i=1\) or not.
</p>

<p>
By Lemma 2 there is a circuit of size \(O(2^{2^m})\) which implements <i>all</i> possibly
required \(g_c\) at once. How many <i>additional</i> gates do we need to fully implement \(f\)? It
is helpful to define \(k=n-m\) and do induction over \(k\), keeping \(m\) fixed. Lets call the
required number of gates \(a_k\). Let us write the formula for \(f\) in the following form:
</p>

<p>
\[
  f(x) = \sum_{c_1\in\{0,1\}} y_1^{c_1} \left( \sum_{(c_2,\ldots,c_k)} \prod_{i=2}^k y_i^{c_i} \cdot g_c(z) \right)
  = y_1' f_0(x_2,\ldots,x_n) + y_1 f_1(x_2,\ldots,x_n) .
\]
</p>

<p>
Note that \(f_0\) and \(f_1\) are functions like \(f\) but with "their" \(k\) being one less. Hence
</p>

<p>
\[ a_{k+1} \leq 4 + 2a_k . \]
</p>

<p>
By induction we get \(a_k=O(2^k)=O(2^{n-m})\). So in total there are at most this many gates
needed to implement \(f\):
</p>

<p>
\[
  O(2^{2^m} + 2^{n-m}) .
\]
</p>

<p>
Note that \(m\) is a free parameter in that formula. We will minimize the expression. For
simplicity let us replace \(2^m\) by a continuous variable \(a\). We have to minimize
\(2^a+2^n/a\). But that is pretty simple (if we are not interested in constant global
factors) Let us just set \(a=n/2\) and we get
</p>

<p>
\[
  O(2^{n/2} + 2^n/n) = O(2^n/n) .
\]

Prove that a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the factors of a number \(m\) exists if

Let \(n=O(\log(x))\) be the number of bits of \(x\). Let \(f(n)=\Omega(n)\) be a function such
that <code>factp</code> runs in \(O(f(n))\) steps. Note that all <i>basic</i> arithmetic operations, within
the above function are (theoretically) \(O(n)\) since the numbers involved are not larger
then \(2x\) and we only add or multiply by the very peculiar number two which works nice
with binary numbers (we could easily avoid the powers of two but I kept them for
readability).
</p>

<p>
This algorithm calls <code>factp</code> around \(O(n)\) times and hence runs in \(O(nf(n))\)
steps. Clearly the number \(x\) has at most \(\log_2(x)=O(n)\) factors. Hence it suffices to
call this procedure \(O(n)\) times to compute all factors in \(O(n^2f(n))\) steps. QED,

primes with high probability. On the other hand, note that we do not really use the fact
that these numbers are prime (due to our fake implementation of <code>factp</code>):

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8c174f7">
<p>
So we assume that <code>coNP</code> is unequal to <code>NP</code>. There are two possible cases (both can be
true at the same time of course):
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There is a language \(L\) in <code>NP</code> which is not in <code>coNP</code>.</li>
<li>There is a language \(L\) in <code>coNP</code> which is not in <code>NP</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Furthermore note that <code>P</code> is part of the interection of <code>NP</code> and <code>coNP</code>. Hence in both
cases \(L\) cannot be in <code>P</code>. Thus in case 1 we immediately get the claim. We are left with
case 2.
</p>

<p>
But case 2 is not hard either. Just consider the language
</p>

<p>
\[ L^c = \{s\in\Sigma^*; s\notin L\} . \]
</p>

<p>
<i>Any</i> Turing machine solving either of the languages - with our without wittness - can be reused
for the other language, you just have to switch the "interpretation" of the two output
states (yes/no). In case a wittness is used the wittness can be reused too.
</p>

<p>
Two things follows from that: If there were a Turing machine solving either language in
polynomial time, it would also solve the other language in polynomial time. Because we are
in case 2, non of these languages is in <code>P</code>. On the other hand \(L^c\) is in <code>NP</code> by the
above argument (Turing machine with wittness). Hence <code>NP</code> contains a language (\(L^c\))
which is not in <code>P</code>. QED.

<h4 id="orgdffc5b6">Proof</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdffc5b6">
<p>
Let \(m\) be the number of edges of the graph. Note that \(m=O(n^2)\). We show the more
informative bound \(O(m)\) for the first statement and \(O(nm)\) for the second. Note that for
unconnected graphs \(m\) might be much smaller than \(n\). Even \(m=0\) is possible which is a
bit annoying when writing \(O(nm)\), in that case we interpret the latter as \(O(n)\) - sorry
for the abuse of notation!
</p>

<p>
Let us first prove the second part. The connectedness of a graph can be checked as
follows. Take any vertex <code>A</code> and then check if it is connected to any of the other \(n-1\)
vertices. If the answer is always "yes" the graph is connected, otherwise it is not. Since
we called the <code>REACHABILITY</code> subroutine \(n-1\) times this needs \(O(nm)\) operations -
assuming the subroutine, as we have to prove, needs \(O(m)\) operations.
</p>

<p>
Let us turn our attention to <code>REACHABILITY</code> of two vertices <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.
</p>

<p>
Preliminaries: The algorithm to be described uses two colors, <i>green</i> and <i>red</i>, to color
the edges of the graph. One way to implement such operations without modifying the data
structure holding the graph is to build up a copy of the graph in terms of a modified data
structure where this is possible. This can be done in \(O(\max(n,m))\) operations. It can
even be done in \(O(m)\) steps if the auxiliary data structure is build up on the fly - just
representing the connected region around <code>A</code> as we explore it. For simplicity of
exposition we just assume that the original data structure supports these operations.
</p>

<p>
When we say we <i>toggle</i> the color of an edge we mean that red gets green and green gets
red.
</p>

<p>
Now we are in the position to describe the algorithm. First let us fix the pre- and
post-conditions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Precondition: The input is a graph with all edges being green.</li>
<li>Post condition: All edges are green (again), more generally the graph is not modified in
any way. It returns the correct answer to the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And here is how the algorithm operates:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(I) Initialize a set <code>pending_nodes</code> with just one element <code>A</code>.</li>
<li>(L) Loop over the following until <code>pending_nodes</code> is empty:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(L1) Take a vertex <code>V</code> from <code>pending_nodes</code> and remove it from the set.</li>
<li>(L2) Look at each edge of <code>V</code> and toggle its color.</li>
<li>(L3) Consider all vertices connected to <code>V</code> via red nodes and add them to
<code>pending_nodes</code>. If one of them is <code>B</code> go to (Y).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(N) Cleanup and return <code>no</code> (and halt).</li>
<li>(Y) Cleanup and return <code>yes</code> (and halt).</li>
</ul>

<p>
With "Cleanup" we mean to make all remaining red edges green again to ensure the first
part of post condition. Of course, if we had a copy of the graph (or of the relevant
connected component) this won't be necessary. Anyway, this can be done in \(O(m)\) steps and
hence it does not hurt much.
</p>

<p>
To prevent a double insertion into <code>pending_nodes</code> in (L3) we can for example add a flag
to each vertex saying whether it is already <i>pending</i> or not. This allows us to implement
<code>pending_nodes</code> as a simple list, with for example, just two operations: <i>push</i> an element
to the end and <i>pop</i> an element from the end. In "ordinary" computers these operations
often run in constant time. Of course, if an implementation of a <i>set</i> is available which
allows <i>checked</i> insertion in constant time we could just use that (maybe a hash-set).
</p>

<p>
We call a vertex <i>visited</i> if it leaves the <i>pending</i> state (gets taken out of
<code>pending_nodes</code>). It is not hard to see by induction over the steps of the algorithm that
a visited vertex never gets pending again and that each edge gets red at most one time.
</p>

<p>
Hence we operate at most \(O(m)\) time on the edges. But we also operate at most \(O(m)\)
times on vertices since we never leave the connected component where <code>A</code> lives. QED
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Remark</dt><dd>Note that the term <i>operation</i> is somewhat vague (which is OK!). I
interpreted it as a simple task which can be done on a <i>real</i> computer in <i>essentially</i>
constant time (like random access into memory). I doubt that one can find a Turing
machine (taking the definition of the book) which solves <code>REACHABILITY</code> in \(O(n^2)\)
steps.</dd>

give a constructive procedure for finding an Euler cycle.

<h4 id="orge793480">Proof</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge793480">
<p>
To see Euler's Theorem consider a graph with \(m\) edges and an Euler cycle. Let us draw
tiny arrows at each edge showing the direction in which we walk. Moreover enumerate the
edges along the path from \(0\) to \(m-1\) along the path - starting at an arbitrary
position. Let us identify the edges with its numbers.
</p>

<p>
Consider one of the vertices \(v\). Let \(i\) be one of the edges whose arrow points towards
\(v\). Clearly \(i+1\) (modulo \(m\)) is an edge at \(v\) whose arrow points away from \(v\). Let
\(j\) be one of the edges whose arrow points away from \(v\). Clearly \(i-1\) (modulo \(m\)) is an
edge at \(v\) whose arrow points towards \(v\). We see that the edges around \(v\) always come
in pairs \((i,i+1)\) where the first one is the "entering" edge and the last one is the
"leaving" edge. Thus, the number of edges at \(v\) must be even. Since \(v\) was arbitrary
this proves the Theorem.
</p>

<p>
Our procedure to compute the Euler cycle makes use of the following subroutine
<code>PartialCycle</code>. Given a vertex \(v\) and a set of <i>admissible</i> edges the subroutine computes
a nonempty closed path, containing \(v\) and only admissible edges.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>input: a graph,a vertex \(v_s\) of the graph, and a set of admissible edges of the graph.</li>
<li>(I) Set the <i>current vertex</i> equal to \(v_s\).</li>
<li>(L) Loop indefinitely over the following
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(L1) Take an unvisited admissible edge \(e\) of the current vertex to some vertex \(v\).</li>
<li>(L2) Walk over \(e\) to \(v\).</li>
<li>(L3) Set \(v\) to be the new current vertex.</li>
<li>(L4) If \(v=v_s\) return the constructed path and halt.</li>
<li>(L5) Mark \(e\) as visited.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that (L1) implicitly assumes that we actually find an unvisited admissible edge. If
this is always the case it is easy to see that the algorithm does what we want. Also note
that each vertex having an even number of admissible edges and \(v_s\) having at least
<i>some</i> admissible edges guarantees that (L1) always succeeds!
</p>

<p>
Let us formulate the complete procedure for finding an Euler cycle. As a precondition we
assume that each vertex has an even number of edges and that the graph is connected (the
latter implying that no vertex has zero edges). This is justified by Euler's theorem.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Call <code>PartialCycle</code> on some arbitrarily chosen vertex with all edges being admissible.</li>
<li>Initialize a path \(p\) with the output of the previous step.</li>
<li>Loop indefinitely over the following:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Choose a vertex \(v\) having edges not already in \(p\). Halt if none exists.</li>
<li>Call <code>PartialCycle</code> on \(v\) allowing only the complement of the edges of \(p\) as
admissible. Enlarge \(p\) by inserting the output into \(p\) directly after \(v\).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
It is not hard to see that the procedure halts if and only if the path \(p\) is already an
Euler cycle. QED.

By definition there are polynomial-time reduction functions \(R_{12}\) and \(R_{23}\) from
\(L_1\) to \(L_2\) and from \(L_2\) to \(L_3\) respectively.
</p>

<p>
Clearly \(R_{23}\,\circ\,R_{12}\) is a reduction function from \(L_1\) to \(L_3\). It remains to
show that it is polynomial-time.
</p>

<p>
But first let us note that under a few minor assumptions the composition of two Turing
machines can be implemented very naturally. The assumptions are that the input is
presented as a "▶" followed by \(x\) followed by infinitely (or sufficiently) many
blanks. The output is required to be in the same format. At the start and when the machine
halts we require the head to be at the (single) "▶" (which is not to be
modified). Moreover we assume that the set of states of the two Turing machines is
disjoint (if it is not make them disjoint). Under these assumptions the composition of
both Turing machines is obtained by concatenating the two corresponding programs (not
important which one first), defining the start state of the first machine as the common
start state, the halting states of the second machine as the common halting state, adding
program lines which make sure to translate the halting states of the first one into the
start state of the second one (suffices when the head is at "▶").
</p>

<p>
In the following let us identify the reduction functions with concrete Turing machines
implementing them.
</p>

<p>
Let \(t(R,x)\) be the number of steps needed by \(R\) to compute \(R(x)\). Note that
\(|R(x)|\leq|x|+t(R,x)\) since a Turing machine writes at most one symbol to the tape at
each time step. By assumption there is a polynomial \(p(n)=C(1+n^k)\) such that
</p>

<p>
\[
  t(R,x) \leq p(|x|) \text{ for } R\in \{R_{12}, R_{23}\} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Hence
</p>

<p>
\[
  t(R_{23}\,\circ\,R_{12}, x) \leq t(R_{12}, x) + \max_{|y| \leq |x| + p(|x|)} t(R_{23}, y)
  \leq p(|x|) + p(|x| + p(|x|)) .
\]

The RHS clearly is a polynomial in the length \(|x|\) of \(x\). QED.

We assume that the reduction relation for the class is transitive in the same way as for

Let us now return to the actual exercise. Using transitivity this is almost trivial. In
fact, let \(K\) be any problem in the class then \(K\) reduces to \(L\) by completeness of

In boolean formulas we use the following logical connectives: \(\neg\), \(\land\), \(\lor\),
\(\leftrightarrow\) with the obvious meaning. We only sketch the proof of the exercise
statement in the following.
</p>

<p>
The fact that <code>SAT</code> is in NP is intuitively clear. In fact, a <i>possible</i> wittness of the
satisfiability of a boolean function is just a concrete assignment of the input variables.
</p>

<p>
It remains to show that <code>CSAT</code> reduces to <code>SAT</code>. As suggested we label each wire by a
unique variable. In the following we replace each gate by a corresponding formula. For
that we call the input wires \(i\) and the output wires \(o\). We give them an index in case
more than one input and/or output is present.
</p>

Now the boolean formula for the whole circuit is just the conjunction of all these smaller
formulas. It is intuitively clear that this can be done in polynomial time with respect to
the number of gates (including <code>FANOUT</code>). Note that this essentially does not change if we
do not count the <code>FANOUT</code> operations since it is not hard to see that only a polynomial
number of <code>FANOUT</code> is needed to implement any boolean function (so we can just disallow
circuits with super-polynomial (in terms of the number of other gates) many <code>FANOUT</code>
gates). QED.

<h5 id="orgd7d93b5">Proof of Statement 1</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgd7d93b5">
<p>
Note that \((\neg\alpha\lor\beta)\) is identical to both of the <i>implication</i> connectives
\(\alpha\rightarrow\beta\) and \(\neg\beta\to\neg\alpha\). This makes the meaning of the graph very intuitive.
</p>

<p>
A path from \(x\) to \(\neg x\) implies \(x\to\neg x\) (since the implication connective is
transitive and all clauses are implications). This means that a satisfying assignment
cannot have \(x\) to be true. In the same way a path from \(\neg x\) to \(x\) implies
\(\neg\,x\to\,x\). So, if both paths are present there cannot be a satisfying
assignment. That was the easy part.
</p>

<p>
Now assume that no such pair of paths exist. For this direction it is crucial that the
graph has the property that whenever it contains the edge \((\alpha,\beta)\) it also
contains \((\neg\beta,\neg\alpha)\). Otherwise a counterexample for this direction of the
statement is quickly found:
</p>

<p>
\[
  (x\to y) \land (x\to\neg y) \land (\neg x\to x) .
\]
</p>

<p>
Lets call this property the <i>negation symmetry</i>. If there is a path from \(x\) to \(y\) let us
write \(x\tto y\).
</p>

<p>
We call a variable \(x\) a <i>root</i> variable if either \(x\tto\neg x\) or \(\neg x\tto x\). Note
that the assignment of root variables is unique. In the former case necessarily \(x=0\) and
in the latter case \(x=1\). We say \(x\) is <i>fixed</i>. We say that a variable is <i>derived</i> if
there is a (root) variable \(x_1\) or \(x_2\) such that at least one of the following holds
</p>

\begin{align*}
  \neg x_1 \tto x_1 &\tto y \\
  x_1 \tto \neg x_1 &\tto y \\
  \neg x_2 \tto x_2 &\tto \neg y \\
  x_2 \tto \neg x_2 &\tto \neg y
\end{align*}

<p>
Note that a derived variable is also fixed. In the former two cases \(y=1\) and in the
latter two cases \(y=0\) (necessarily). Can it happen that we get a contradictory
assignment, that is, can it happen that an \(x_1\) <i>and</i> an \(x_2\) as above exists? No this
cannot happen. Lets consider the case where line 1 and line 3 hold (the other cases are
similar). In that case, by the negation-symmetry, we also have \(y\tto \neg x_1\) and
\(y\tto\neg x_2\). But this implies (for example) \(x_2\,\tto\,\neg\,x_2\) - a contradiction
to our assumption further above that a variable is not connected to its negation in <i>both</i>
directions.
</p>

<p>
It is not hard to see that the given assignment for root and derived variables is not
contradictory. In fact, it just remains to investigate paths from derived to root, from
root to another root, and derived to another derived. We leave the tedious argumentation
to the reader 😉.
</p>

<p>
There might be variables which are neither root nor derived. One <i>might</i> think that one
can assign them any truth value, but this is not true as can be seen by the very simple
example \(\varphi=x\to y\).
</p>

<p>
Let \(z\) be a variable which is neither root nor derived. There are three possible cases:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>case 1</dt><dd>\[ \exists y_0 : z\tto y_0 \text{ and } z\tto \neg y_0 \]</dd>
<dt>case 2</dt><dd>\[ \exists y_1 : \neg z\tto y_1 \text{ and } \neg z\tto \neg y_1 \]</dd>
<dt>case 3</dt><dd>\[ \text{No such $y_0$ or $y_1$ exists.} \]</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It is not hard to see that \(z\) is fixed in cases 1 and 2. In case 1 necessarily \(z=0\) and
in case 2 necessarily \(z=1\). It is crucial that case 1 and case 2 do not happen at the
same time. If they were it would follow that
</p>

\begin{align*}
  &y_0 \tto \neg z \tto \neg y_1 \tto z \tto \neg y_0 , \\
  &\neg y_0 \tto \neg z \tto y_1 \tto z \tto y_0 . \\
\end{align*}

<p>
A contradiction to our assumption. Now let us replace \(\varphi\) by \(\varphi'\) as follows
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In case 1: \(\varphi'=\varphi\land(z\to\neg z)\).</li>
<li>In case 2: \(\varphi'=\varphi\land(\neg z\to z)\).</li>
<li>In case 3: Do one of the above does not matter which one.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Clearly a solution of \(\varphi'\) is also a solution of \(\varphi\). It is not hard to see
that the graph of \(\varphi'\) still has the property that no variable is connected to its
negation in both directions. In fact, let us assume that we added \(z\to\neg z\) (the other
case is similar). So we are in case 1 or 3. Assume \(\varphi'\) violates the property. Then
there must be a \(y\) which is connected to its negation in both ways and at least of the
paths contains the segment \(z\to\neg z\). But in fact both ways must lead through this
segment since otherwise \(y\) would be a root and \(z\) were derived! Both ways through the
segment means:
</p>

Repeated application of this procedure shows that we can replace \(\varphi\) by a formula
\(\psi\) which still has the property that no variable is connected both ways to its
negation. Moreover \(\psi\) has only root and derived variables. Hence it has a unique
solution (we showed this above). This solution is also a satisfying assignment for
\(\varphi\). QED.

The proof of statement 1 essentially contains an algorithm. In the following we describe a
routine <code>solve</code> to find a satisfying assignment. The algorithm works on the graph
representation of \(\varphi\). It makes use of two subroutines <code>reach</code> and <code>traverse</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>reach(a,b)</code> just decides if vertices <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are connected. This can be done in
\(O(n^2)\) operations if \(n\) is the number of variables (exercise 3.19). The function
<code>traverse(a,f)</code> starts at vertex \(a\) and walks over all vertices reachable by \(a\). It calls
<code>f(v)</code> for each vertex it reaches. Below the callback always has the form <code>v→t</code> where <code>t</code>
is some truth value. If \(v\) is the vertex of some variable \(y\) or its negation it means
that we assign \(y=t\) or \(y=\neg t\) depending on what is the case. Note that <code>traverse</code> can
be implemented by the procedure driving <code>reach</code> (just take <code>b</code> to be some artificial
vertex connected to nothing). So it runs in \(O(n^2)\) operations too.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(R) For each variable \(x\) do:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Check if <code>reach(x,¬x)</code> or <code>reach(¬x,x)</code>.</li>
<li>If both are true halt and return that no assignment exists.</li>
<li>If the first checks out set \(x=0\) and mark \(x\) as <i>root</i>.</li>
<li>If the second checks out set \(x=1\) and mark \(x\) as <i>root</i>.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Call <code>traverse(r,v→r)</code>.</li>
<li>Call <code>traverse(¬r,v→¬r)</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remove all vertices from the graph which where visited by the calls to <code>traverse</code>,
including the root vertices (the function could mark each vertex upon visit to make this
possible). Also remove all "dangling" edges.</li>
<li>Take any of the remaining variables \(z\).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If no such \(z\) exists we are done and we can return the assignments we found.</li>
<li><b>Try</b> to add \(z\to\neg z\) to the graph and call <code>solve</code> recursively on this new graph.</li>

(this does not fail by what we have shown to prove statement 1).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Each call to <code>solve</code>, not including the recursive call, needs \(O(n^3)\) operations. In the
worst case we have to call <code>solve</code> once for each variable which leads to \(O(n^4)\). QED.

<h4 id="org89b0897">Proof</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org89b0897">
<p>
Lets do it as suggested in the hint. Consider a Turing machine and some input of length
\(n\). Let \(S\) be the set of states, and \(\Gamma\) the alphabet for the tape. Let us define
the <i>configuration</i> of the Turing machine to be
</p>

<p>
\[
  (h, s, t) \in \{1,\ldots,p(n)\} \times S \times \Gamma^{p(n)} ,
\]
</p>

<p>
where \(h\) is the head position, \(s\) is the current state and \(t\) the content of the tape
up to position \(p(n)\). By assumption the Turing machine does not use more than the first
\(p(n)\) tape cells.
</p>

<p>
Since the Turing machine is deterministic: if a configuration appears twice the Turing
machine does not halt. Hence if it halts no configuration appears twice. The number of
possible configurations is:
</p>

<p>
\[
  p(n) \cdot l \cdot m^{p(n)} .

<p>
The complexity class <code>L</code> (for logarithmic space) contains all decision problems which may
be decided by a Turing machine running in logarithmic space, that is, in space
\(O(\log(n))\). More precisely, the class \(L\) is defined using a two-tape Turing
machine. The first tape contains the problem instance, of size \(n\), and is a read-only
tape, in the sense that only program lines which don’t change the contents of the first
tape are allowed. The second tape is a working tape which initially contains only
blanks. The logarithmic space requirement is imposed on the second, working tape
only. Show that <code>L ⊆ P</code>.

<div id="outline-container-orgd2f7e71" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd2f7e71">Proof</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd2f7e71">
<p>
The reasoning is basically the same as in the proof of <code>PSPACE ⊆ EXP</code> (exercise 3.25). But
there is the caveat that a priori we have no bound on the possible head positions on the
read-only tape. On the other hand, most definitions of \(L\) do not really lead to this
problem since they require the head position to be stored on the working tape. Therefore
let us first assume that the read-only head can only traverse the \(n\) input cells. We come
back to this restriction at the end of the proof.
</p>

<p>
Following the reasoning of the proof of exercise 3.25 we see that the number of
configurations is at most
</p>

<p>
\[
  n \cdot O(\log(n)) \cdot l \cdot m^{O(\log(n))} = O(\mathrm{poly}(n)) ,
\]
</p>

<p>
where we multiply the possible positions of the read-only head (\(n\)), the possible
positions of the working head (\(O(\log(n)))\), the number of states (\(l\)), the number of
letters (\(m\)) raised to the number of cells to be written \(O(\log(n))\). This proves the
claim.
</p>

<p>
What happens if we do not restrict the read-only head to the first \(n\) inputs? Let us
assume that all other cells are blank (wouldn't make sense to allow that the read head
reads other thing then the actual input). How far can the read-only head travel into the
blank region? The answer is: only a polynomial amount of cells! In fact, during all the
time the head points to a blank and hence does effectively not contribute to the
configuration of the machine. So the amount of <i>consecutive</i> time spend in the blank
region is at most polynomial. Hence the number of positions of the read-only head is
polynomial too. This implies the claim in the general case. QED.

<h4 id="orgf43180f">Proof</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf43180f">
<p>
For simplicity we assume that the Turing machine always halts. I think most definitions of
<code>BPP</code> actually assume this. But this is not really crucial, because a polynomial time
bound is required for the case where the machine guesses the correct value one can just
introduce a step-counter which aborts after some <i>sufficiently</i> large amount of polynomial
time. In this case one can halt in either the accepting or the rejecting state (garbage),
but "in practice" it would certainly be nicer to introduce a new halting state <code>ABORT</code>.
</p>

<p>
Let \(\varepsilon=k-1/2\) and \(r\in\NN\). Consider the Turing machine \(M_r\) which runs \(M\) on
the same input \(r\) times and accepts if most individual runs return accept. It rejects
otherwise. In case of a tie just reject (doesn't really matter but fits better into the
argumentation of Box 3.4). Let us fix an input \(x\) and assume \(x\in L\). The case \(x\notin
L\) is similar and we omit it.
</p>

<p>
Let \(X_i\) be \(1\) if the \(M\) accepts and \(0\) if it rejects upon \(x\) as input.
</p>

<p>
It is intuitively clear that the \(X_i\) are <i>iid</i> (independent, identically
distributed). They are identically distributed since it is always the same machine and
always the same input. They are independent since the individual coin tosses are
independent (certainly a <i>reasonable</i> assumption although it was never explicitly
mentioned in the definition of the probabilistic Turing machine).
</p>

<p>
Hence the Chernoff bound (Box 3.4) implies that \(x\) is accepted by \(M_r\) with probability
at least \(1-e^{-2\varepsilon^2r}\) which goes to \(1\) if \(r\to\infty\). The case \(x\notin L\)
can be treated in the same way (here the \(X_i\) are \(1\) upon rejection and \(0\) upon
acceptance). Hence \(k_r\geq1-e^{-2\varepsilon^2r}\) which can be made arbitrary close to
\(1\) if \(r\) is sufficiently large. QED.

<p>
Clearly the Fredkin gate cannot be implemented by one Toffoli gate since the former
modifies (up to) two bits and the latter only one bit. It is also not very hard to see
that two Toffolis are not sufficient either (even with ancilla bits). In fact, it is clear
that the two targets are already fixed to target the \(x_0\) and the \(x_1\) bit. From that it
follows that both Toffolis must have one control at \(c\) since \(c\) in the Fredkin gate has
an effect on both \(x_0\) and \(x_1\). In the same way the second control is necessarily at
\(x_0\) or \(x_1\) so there is no further freedom.

<p>
Note that the first Fredkin gate is responsible for filling the second to last and the
last wire with \(x\) and \(\overline{x}\). The other two Fredkin gates operate on three wires
two of which contain \(x\) and the third one contains \(\overline{x}\). The \(\overline{x}\) is
moved into the third wire iff \(c_0\) and \(c_1\) are both \(1\).
</p>

<p>
We need ancilla bits since the Fredkin gate is conservative, that is, it preserves the
number of ones (and zeros). The Toffoli gate does not do this. This also implies that we
cannot uncompute the garbage. Note that two ancilla bits a \(0\) <i>and</i> a \(1\) are <i>indeed</i>
required because the Toffoli gate can either increase or decrease the number of ones. Note
that we assume ancilla bits to be zero initialized (qiskit convention) and hence we need a
<code>NOT</code> (here called <code>X</code>) to generate a \(1\) <i>as an initial value</i>.
</p>

<p>
Clearly one Fredkin gate cannot produce the Toffoli gate. Let us demonstrate that it is
still not possible with two Fredkin gates.
</p>

<p>
Assume that to the contrary that an implementation with just two Fredkin gates
exists. None of the targets of the first Fredkin gate lies on the first or second
wire. Otherwise the second gate had to be used to move back the bit of that wire and hence
had to occupy the same targets and the same control - there are a few corner cases for
which this is not needed but they do not work for trivial reasons. It follows that also
the second gate cannot have a target on one of the first two wires. On the other hand the
operation must depend on <i>both</i> \(c_0\) and \(c_1\) hence the controls must occupy \(c_0\) and
\(c_1\). Without loss of generality we may assume that the first gate has \(c_0\) as control
and the second gate has \(c_1\) as control. Clearly, the second gate must have the third wire
as one of its targets since otherwise it would not contribute to the result. The other
target must be an ancilla bit. Hence we have the following situation:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org7979caa">
c_0: ─■────

c_1: ────■─
         │
  x: ────X─
         │
  ?: ────X─
</pre>

<p>
Meaning that the second gate is already fixed and that we know the control of the first
gate. Right before the execution of the second gate the fourth wire must contain
\(\overline{x}\) if \(c_0=1\). Clearly there is no way how the first gate could accomplish that
(in general). Contradiction! Hence three Fredkin gates are necessary.
</p>

<p>
We have already seen that two ancilla bits are necessarily required (a \(0\) and a
\(1\)). Hence the given construction is optimal in the number of gates and ancilla bits at
the same time.
