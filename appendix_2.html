For me <i>Character Theory</i> was rather new when I accountered the appendix for the first
time. I found it hard to learn it from this Appendix so I searched for alternative
resources. I think Chapters 1 and 2 of (William Fulton and Joe Harris, 2004) constitutes a gentle
introduction to the topic. I only skimmed over it, so I am not sure, but what I know is
that this made the topic much clearer to me.
</p>

<p>
In this section I briefly summarize <i>how I</i> learned the <i>very basics</i> of this nice
theory. I refer to the exercises when appropriate. It duplicates a lot of things from the
(Nielsen, Michael A. and Chuang, Isaac L., 2011). But in my oppinion certain crucial things are missing in the
book. To make it self contained I decided to repeat certain things.

Let \((G,\cdot,e)\) be a group. A <b>matrix representation</b> of \(G\) is a homomorphism of groups
\(\rho:G\to M\) where \(M\) is a group of matrices over some complex vector space \(V\) (other
ground fields are possible but we do not care here). Homomorphism just means
</p>

<p>
\[
  \forall g,h: \rho(gh) = \rho(g)\rho(h) \; \text{ and } \; \rho(g\inv) = \rho(g)\inv
  \; \text{ and } \; \rho(e) = I .
\]
</p>

<p>
A matrix representation is called <b>irreducible</b> if it has no non-trivial invariant
subspaces \(W\); non-trivial meaning \(W\notin\{0,V\}\). Invariant means
\(\rho(g)W\,\subseteq\,W\) for all \(g\).
</p>

<p>
A matrix representation is called <b>indecomposable</b> if \(\rho\) cannot be written as a direct
sum \(\rho_1\oplus\rho_2\) over non-trivial subspaces \(V_1\oplus V_2=V\). It is clear that
irreducible matrix groups are also indecomposable. The reverse direction also holds for
finite groups (see (William Fulton and Joe Harris, 2004) Proposition 1.5). The proof is not very difficult
once the fact that representations of finite groups are <a href="#unitary-representations">equivalent to unitary groups</a> is
established.
</p>

<p>
Let \(\rho\) be a finite-dimensional matrix representation over \(\CC\). The <b>character</b> of
\(\rho\) is \(\chi_\rho:G\to\CC\) given by:
</p>

<p>
\[
  \chi_\rho(g) = \trace{\rho(g)} .
\]
</p>

<p>
The character is called <b>irreducible</b> if \(\rho\) is irreducible. The <b>degree</b> of the
character is the dimension of the vector space.
</p>

<p>
Characters are a special case of the so called <b>class functions</b>, these are functions
\(\alpha:G\to\CC\) such that
</p>

<p>
\[
  \forall g,h: \; \alpha(h^{-1} g h) = \alpha(g) .
\]
</p>

<p>
For characters this holds due to \(\trace{AB}=\trace{BA}\).
</p>

<p>
Basic properties of characters are proved in <a href="#exercise-a2-11">exercise A2.11</a>. The proof shows that for a
finite group \(\chi(g)\) is a sum of \(r\)​th roots of unity where \(r\) is the order of \(g\).
</p>

<p>
Two representations are called <b>equivalent</b> if they are isomorphic and the isomorphism
preserves the corresponding characters. A linear map \(S:V\to W\in\hom(V,W)\) is called
<b>G-linear</b> if
</p>

<p>
<a id="orge2d7871"></a>
\[
  \forall g: \rho_W(g) \, S = S \, \rho_V(g) .
\]
</p>

<p>
Let us denote by \(\hom(\rho^V,\rho^W)\), or \(\hom_G(V,W)\) (G-homomorphisms), the subset of
those homomorphisms between \(V\) and \(W\) (\(\hom(V,W)\)) which are G-linear. This makes the
class of representations of \(G\) into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(mathematics)">category</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a id="org4c4419c"></a>
Clearly two representations are equivalent iff there exists a G-isomorphism between them.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#schurs-lemma">Schur's Lemma</a> will tell us that up to a scalar factor there is at most one non-zero
G-homomorphisms between two irreducible finite dimensional representations, which is an
isomorphism if it exists.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-unitary-representations">
<p>
A matrix group is called <i>unitary</i> if every matrix is unitary. In <a href="#exercise-a2-12">exercise A2.12</a> it is
shown that every representation of a finite group is equivalent to a unitary
representation. The proof shows that the transformation is essentially a change of scalar
product:
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho(g) \mapsto \sqrt{p} \rho(g) \sqrt{p}\inv ,
\]
</p>

<p>
where \(p\) is some suitably chosen positive definite matrix. The technique to obtain \(p\)
via <i>averaging</i> is standard in Character Theory.

<h3 id="org58f3bbd">Constructing new from old representations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org58f3bbd">
<p>
Assuming we have a representation on certain vector spaces \(V\), \(W\) we can construct new
ones like in the following listing. Note that sometimes we write \(gv\) instead of
\(\rho_V(g)v\) if we are not at risk of ambiguity. Just for this section we briefly allow a
general ground field \(\KK\) instead of \(\CC\). I think this aids understanding the
construction for dual spaces - in my opinion.
</p>

<p>
Tensor products \(V\otimes W\):
</p>

<p>
\[ g(v\otimes w) := gv \otimes gw . \]
</p>

<p>
Direct sums \(V\oplus W\):
</p>

<p>
\[ g(v\oplus w) := gv \oplus gw . \]
</p>

<p>
Homomorphism spaces \(\hom(V, W)\):
</p>

<p>
\[
  g\phi = g \circ \phi \circ g\inv
\]
</p>

<p>
Dual spaces \(V^*\):
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho_{V^*}(g) = \rho_V(g\inv)^\dagger .
\]
</p>

<p>
The definition for dual spaces is natural since it is a consequence from the natural
requirement to preserve the natural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_system">dual pairing</a>:
</p>

<p>
\[ \langle gv^*, gv \rangle_{V^*,V} = \langle v^*, v \rangle_{V^*,V} . \]
</p>

<p>
The formula for homomorphisms is motivated by \(\hom(V,W)=V^*\otimes W\)
</p>

\begin{align*}
  \rho_{V^*\otimes W}(g) \langle v^*, \cdot \rangle w
    &= \langle \rho_{V^*}(g)v^*, \cdot \rangle \rho_W(g)w \\
    &= \langle \rho_{V}(g\inv)^\dagger v^*, \cdot \rangle \rho_W(g)w \\
    &= \langle v^*, \rho_V(g\inv)(\cdot) \rangle \rho_W(g)w \\
    &= \rho_{\hom(V,W)}(g) \langle v^*, \cdot \rangle w .
\end{align*}

<p>
and is consistent with \(V^*=\hom(V,\KK)\).
</p>

\begin{align*}
  \rho_{\hom(V,\KK)}(g) \langle v^*, \cdot\rangle
    &= \rho_\KK(g) \langle v^*, \rho_V(g\inv)(\cdot)\rangle \\
    &= \langle \rho_V(g\inv)^\dagger v^*, \cdot\rangle \\
    &= \rho_{V^*}(g) \langle v^*, \cdot\rangle .
\end{align*}

<p>
Moreover the dual representation behaves well for unitary representations with the natural
identification of the dual space with the Hilbert space itself: \(\rho^*=\rho\) in this
case.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-schurs-lemma">
<p>
Let \(G\) be a group and \(\rho_V\), \(\rho_W\) two irreducible representations on non-trivial
complex vector spaces \(V\) and \(W\). Let \(S:V\to W\) be a <code>G</code>-linear map, the latter meaning:
</p>

<p>
<a id="orgc249be0"></a>
\[
  \forall g: \rho_W(g) \, S = S \, \rho_V(g) .
\]
</p>

<p>
Then either
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(S=0\) or</li>
<li>\(S\) is an <b>isomorphism</b> of vector spaces.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Moreover, if \(\rho_V=\rho_W\) and the vector spaces are finite-dimensional, necessarily
\(S=\alpha I\) for some \(\alpha\in\CC\). If \(\rho_V\neq\rho_W\) are finite-dimensional and
\(S_1\), \(S_2\) are two isomorphisms as above then each of them is a scalar multiple of the
other one.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Remarks</dt><dd><ul class="org-ul">
<li>One could weaken the assumptions by replacing \(\rho_V(G)\) and \(\rho_W(G)\) by any two matrix
groups \(G\) and \(H\) which have equal cardinality \(I\) and replace the above <a href="#orgc249be0">relation</a> by
\(g_iS=Sh_i\) for \(i\,\in\,I\). The proof below shows this implicitly. In the isomorphism case we
see that \(H\) and \(G\) are in fact <i>equivalent</i>.</li>
<li>Schur's Lemma essentially says that for irreducible representations
\(\hom(\rho^V,\rho^W)\) is zero or one-dimensional. In the latter case the non-zero
elements are (G-)isomorphisms.</li>
</ul></dd>
</dl>

<p>
PROOF: Let \(N\subseteq V\) and \(R\subseteq W\) the kernel (null-space) and image (range) of
\(S\). Clearly those are invariant under the respective representations of \(G\). By
irreducibility we have:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(N \in \{0, V\}\),</li>
<li>\(R \in \{0, W\}\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
This leads to four cases two of which are impossible (both zero-space or both full-space) since \(V\)
and \(W\) are non-trivial. The other two cases are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(N=\{0\}\) and \(R=W\), meaning \(S\) being an isomorphism,</li>
<li>\(N=V\) and \(R=\{0\}\), meaning \(S=0\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
This shows the first part. Now consider the second part where (among other things) \(V=W\)
is assumed. Since \(\CC\) is algebraically closed and the vector spaces are finite
dimensional \(S\) must have an eigenvalue \(\alpha\). Clearly \(S-\alpha\) satisfies the
<a href="#orgc249be0">G-linearity</a> in place of \(S\) too. By the first part and since \(S-\alpha\) is no isomorphism
we must have \(S=\alpha\).
</p>

<p>
The final part follows from the second part by considering the G-linear mappings
composed of G-linear mappings from \(V\) to \(W\) and back from \(W\) to \(V\). QED.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-decomposition-of-representations">
<p>
Let \(V\) be a complex representation of a finite group \(G\). Then the vector space \(V\)
decomposes into irreducible sub-representations
</p>

<p>
\[
  V = V^{\oplus a_1}_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus V^{\oplus a_n}_n
\]
</p>

<p>
with distinct (irreducible) \(V_i\). Moreover the \(V_i\) and the \(a_i\) are unique. If the
representation is unitary the decomposition is orthogonal.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Remarks</dt><dd><ul class="org-ul">
<li>The statment probably holds on compact groups (use Haar measure in proof).</li>
<li>What is not unique (in general) is the decomposition of the \(V_i^{\oplus a_i}\) into
\(a_i\) copies of \(V_i\). In fact, look at the trivial group action of
\(\langle\,\mathrm{id}\rangle\) on \(\CC^2\). The <i>concrete</i> decomposition essentially
amounts to a choice of a basis.</li>
</ul></dd>
</dl>

<p>
I could not find a proof of the <i>complete</i> statement which I could understand. So I give
my own here.
</p>

<p>
PROOF: We may assume that the representation is unitary (see <a href="#unitary-representations">above</a>).
</p>

<p>
If \(V\) is not already reducible there must be a non-trivial invariant subspace \(U\). Since the
representation is unitary the orthogonal complement \(U^\perp\) is invariant too. Hence we have the
decomposition
</p>

<p>
\[
  V = U \oplus U^{\perp} .
\]
</p>

<p>
The existence now follows by induction on the dimension of \(V\) and the fact that one-dimensional
representations are always irreducible. This concludes the existence part of the proof.
</p>

<p>
For the uniqueness consider another decomposition
</p>

<p>
\[
  V = W^{\oplus b_1}_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus W^{\oplus b_m}_m .
\]
</p>

<p>
Note that the identity induces an isomorphism
</p>

<p>
\[
  V^{\oplus a_1}_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus V^{\oplus a_n}_n
  \to W^{\oplus b_1}_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus W^{\oplus b_m}_m .
\]
</p>

<p>
Let us denote by \(\hom_G(V,W)\) the G-linear maps between \(V\) and \(W\). Note that
</p>

<p>
\[
  \hom_G(V, V) = \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \bigoplus_{j=1}^m
  \hom_G(V_i, W_j)^{\oplus a_i b_j} .
\]
</p>

<p>
This holds also for \(\hom_G\) replaced by \(\hom\). In fact, this statement is analogous to
the fact that linear maps between finite dimensional vector spaces can be represented by
matrices.
</p>

<p>
Now suppose that for some \(i\) the \(V_i\) is not equivalent to any of the \(W_j\). Then this
together with Schur's Lemma implies that \(V_i\) is mapped to \(0\) by the identity map -
contradiction. By symmetry this implies that \(n=m\) and \(V_i=W_{\pi(i)}\) for some
permutation \(\pi\). Without loss of generality \(\pi=\mathrm{id}\).
</p>

<p>
Again by Schur's lemma we thus have \(\hom(V_i,W_j)=0\) for \(i\neq j\) and hence:
</p>

<p>
\[
  \hom_G(V, V) = \bigoplus_{i=1}^n
  \hom_G(V_i, W_i)^{\oplus a_i b_i} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Hence the identity on \(V\) induces a G-isomorphism between \(V_i^{a_i}\) and \(W_i^{b_i}\). Since the
dimensions of \(V_i\) and \(W_i\) are the same (by equivalence) this implies \(a_i=b_i\). QED.

<div id="outline-container-class-functions-hilbert-space" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="class-functions-hilbert-space">Class Functions as a Hilbert Space</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-class-functions-hilbert-space">
<p>
Recall that the class functions are constant on all conjugacy classes
</p>

<p>
\[
  \mathrm{Cl}(a) = \{g a g\inv; g\in G \} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Hence for a finite group the space of class functions is a \(k\) dimensional vector space
where \(k\) is the number of different conjugacy classes (the indicator functions of the
single conjugacy classes form a basis).
</p>

<p>
Using the following scalar product, the vector space turns into a Hilbert Space:
</p>

<p>
\[
  \langle \alpha, \beta \rangle =
  \frac{1}{\abs{G}} \sum_{g\in G} \alpha(g)^* \beta(g) .
\]
</p>

<p>
It turns out that the irreducible characters are an orthonormal basis of this Hilbert
Space. This should be shown in <a href="#exercise-a2-15">exercise A2.15</a>. This exercise however bases the proof on a
more difficult result so it does not really help to understand this nice result. For a
direct proof have a look into (William Fulton and Joe Harris, 2004), Chapter 2.2. I recommend to read the
proof, it is really nice. You can also try to find it on your own based on the following
hints:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
The map
</p>

<p>
\[
    p = \frac{1}{\abs{G}} \sum_{g\in G} g
  \]
</p>

<p>
is a projection from \(V\) to \(V^G:=\{v\in V; \forall g: gv=v\}\).
</p></li>
<li><p>
Hence
</p>

<p>
\[
    \dim V^G = \chi_V(p) = \frac{1}{\abs{G}} \sum_{g\in G} \chi_V(g) .
  \]
</p></li>
<li>We have \(\hom_G(V,W)=\hom(V,W)^G\).</li>
<li>If \(V\) and \(W\) are irreducible by Schur's Lemma we have that \(\dim(\hom_G(V,W))\) is
either \(1\) or \(0\) depending on whether \(V\) and \(W\) are isomorphic or not.</li>
<li>Finally use \(\chi_{\hom(V,W)}(g)=\chi_{V^*}(g)\otimes\chi_W(g)=\chi_{V}(g)^*\otimes\chi_W(g)\) to
deduce the claim.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a corollary of the above we see that the number of distinct irreducible characters is
equal to the number of conjugacy classes.
</p>

<p>
With the notation of <a href="#decomposition-of-representations">decomposition of representations</a> we see that a general character
decomposes like this into irreducible characters:
</p>

<p>
<a id="orga12cedf"></a>
\[
  \chi_V = \sum_{i=1}^n a_n \chi_{V_i}
\]
</p>

<p>
<a id="orgbebe3f7"></a>
In particular we deduce that a character is irreducible iff its norm is \(1\) (all other
characters have a larger norm).

A unitary matrix group is comprised solely of unitary matrices. Show that every finite

An example of a non-unitary matrix group is generated by
</p>

<p>
\[
  g = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & a \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Clearly \(\langle g \rangle = \{I, g\}\), since \(g^2=I\). Moreover \(g\) is not unitary for any
\(a\neq0\). On the other hand \(g\) is diagonalizable (its eigenvalues are \(\pm1\)). Note that
the claim of the exercise implies diagonalizability for <i>any</i> representation of a finite
group! In fact, equivalence to a unitary group <a href="#org4c4419c">means</a> that there is a G-isomorphism \(h\)
such that \(hgh\inv\) is unitary and hence diagonalizable. But if \(hgh\inv\) is
diagonalizable the same is true for \(g\).
</p>

<p>
On the other hand for \(a\neq0\) the following is a generator for a faithful representation
of \(\ZZ\) which is <i>not</i> diagonalizable (up to a factor the matrix is already in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_normal_form">Jordan

<p>
\[
  g = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & a \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} .

<div id="outline-container-orgc0a9bc7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc0a9bc7">Proof</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc0a9bc7">
<p>
Let us define the positive semi-definite operator (identifying group elements with their
matrix representation)
</p>

<p>
\[
  p = \sum_{h\in G} h^\dagger h .
\]
</p>

<p>
This operator is invertible since \(\bra{u}p\ket{u} > 0\) for any non-zero vector \(u\). By
the functional calculus for hermitian matrices we can uniquely define a positive
semi-definite operator \(\sqrt{p}\) whose square is \(p\) (if \(p\) is already diagonal just
take the square roots of each entry and else apply the spectral theorem first to make it
diagonal). The matrix \(\sqrt{p}\) is invertible too.
</p>

<p>
Now define the mapping \(\phi\) as the conjugation with \(\sqrt{p}\):
</p>

<p>
\[
  \phi: g \mapsto \sqrt{p} g \sqrt{p}^{-1}.
\]
</p>

<p>
It is easy to see that this is an isomorphism of \(G\) to some other matrix group
\(G'\). Moreover this matrix group is unitary since every \(g\in G\) acts as a permutation on
\(G\) which implies:
</p>

<p>
\[
  \phi(g)^\dagger \phi(g) = \sqrt{p}^{-1} g^\dagger p g \sqrt{p}^{-1}
  = \sqrt{p}^{-1} \sum_{h\in G} (hg)^\dagger hg \sqrt{p}^{-1}

<h4 id="org8a6715c">Proof</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8a6715c">
<p>
Consider the first equality. We have
</p>

<p>
\[
  \sum_{i=1}^r r_i (\chi_i^p)^* \chi_i^q
  = \sum_{g\in G} \chi^p(g)^* \chi^q(g) .
\]
</p>

<p>
Moreover \(\chi^p(g)^*=\chi^p(g\inv)\) by <a href="#exercise-a2-11">exercise A2.11(5)</a>. Hence
</p>

<p>
\[
  \sum_{i=1}^r r_i (\chi_i^p)^* \chi_i^q
  = \sum_g \sum_{ij} \rho^p(g)\inv_{ii} \rho^q(g)_{jj} .
\]
</p>

<p>
By the fundamental theorem this is zero (as desired) if \(p\neq q\). So let us assume \(p=q\)
in the following:
</p>

<p>
\[
  \sum_{i=1}^r r_i (\chi_i^p)^* \chi_i^p
  = \sum_{ij} \sum_g \rho^p(g)\inv_{ii} \rho^p(g)_{jj}
  = \sum_{ij} \abs{G} d_{\rho^p}\inv \delta_{ij} = \abs{G} .
\]
</p>

<p>
This proves the first formula. The second formula actually follows automatically from the
first one as we will see now. Consider the square matrix \(U\in\CC^{r\times r}\) given by:
</p>

<p>
\[
  U_{ip} = \chi_i^p \cdot \sqrt{\frac{r_i}{\abs{G}}} .

<p>
Observe that the two statemtents from the exercise are equivalent to the assertion
that \(U\) has orthonormal columns or rows respectively (with respect to the standard scalar
product on \(\CC^r\)). It is well known that either of these is equivalent to \(U\) being
unitary. Hence if one of them holds (as we just proved) the other one holds too. QED.

not irreducible <a href="#orgbebe3f7">since</a> a character is irreducible iff its norm is \(1\). We can also see this
directly by observing that \(V_{\mathrm{triv}}=\CC(1,1,1)\) is an invariant subspace.

</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho_{\mathrm{triv}}(g) = 1 \in \CC .

<p>
Let us briefly mention that this is related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_of_a_permutation">parity of permutations</a>, and can
alternatively calculated by counting the number of binary swaps \((x \; y)\) in the cycle
representation (odd count means \(-1\), even count means \(+1\)).
</p>

<p>
Let \(V_{\mathrm{std}}=V_{\mathrm{triv}}^\perp\). By definition
</p>

<p>
\[ \CC^3=V_{\mathrm{triv}}\oplus V_{\mathrm{std}} . \]
</p>

<p>
We claim that \(\rho_{\mathrm{perm}}\) restricted to \(V_{\mathrm{std}}\) is the 2D
representation \(\rho_{\mathrm{std}}\) presented in the exercise statement (for a certain
choice of basis in \(V_{\mathrm{std}}\)). But first let us observe that this restriction is
indeed irreducible. In fact (c.f. <a href="#orga12cedf">decomposition of characters</a>):
</p>

<p>
\[
  \chi_{\mathrm{std}} = \chi_{\mathrm{perm}} - \chi_{\mathrm{triv}}
  = (2, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0) .
\]
</p>

<p>
The norm of this is \(1\). Hence we know that it must be irreducible although we haven't
calculated the representation yet! Let us show that

<p>
How did we find it? It is clear that we have to choose a spanning vector of the invariant
subspace \(\CC(1,1,1)\) as the first column to obtain the trivial representation as the
first summand. How to choose the other two columns is only important to obtain the
<i>particular</i> matrices given in the exercise. The second column is easily seen to be a
multiple of \((1,1,0)\) when looking at the fourth matrix. The last column is essentially
fixed by the unitarity constraint.

\[
  v = \sum_{h \in G} \lambda_h h ,

  \rho^R(g)_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } g g_i=g_j \\ 0 & \text{else.} \end{cases}

\(g g_i=g_i\) is equivalent to \(g=e\). Hence \(\rho^R(g)\) has <i>any</i> non-zero entries on
the diagonal iff \(g=e\). QED.

Use Theorem A2.5 to show that the regular representation contains \(d_{\rho^p}\) instances
of each irreducible representation \(\rho^p\). Thus, if \(R\) denotes the regular
representation, and \(\hat{G}\) denotes the set of all inequivalent irreducible
representations, then

\[
  \chi_i^R = \sum_{\rho \in \hat{G}} d_\rho \chi_i^\rho .

By Theorem A2.4 (the fundamental theorem) the irreducible representations are an
orthonormal basis of the Hilbert Space of class functions (see <a href="#class-functions-hilbert-space">here</a> too). Hence

<p>
\[
  \chi^R = \sum_{\rho\in\hat{G}} c_\rho \chi^\rho

\[
  c_\rho = \langle \chi^\rho, \chi^R \rangle = \abs{G}\inv \chi^\rho(e)^* \chi^R(e) = d_\rho .
