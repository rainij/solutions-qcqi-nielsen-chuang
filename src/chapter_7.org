** Harmonic Oscillator
To simplify calculations we will use unit-less expressions. To do this let $\tilde{x}$,
$\tilde{p}$, etc denote physical quantities /with/ units and denote the unit-less versions
without the tilde, such that e.g.

<<unitless-position-and-momentum>>
$$
  \tilde{x} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m\omega}} \; x, \quad \tilde{p} = \sqrt{m\omega\hbar} \; p .
$$

Note that this implies $p=-\ii\partial_x$. The effect on $H$ and $a$ is the same as
setting $m=\hbar=\omega=1$ (we have e.g. $H=p^2/2+x^2/2$).

In this chapter let us use the python based computer algebra system [[https://www.sagemath.org/][sage]] to solve the
exercises (some of them). For this reason we define momentum and position operator in code
as follows:

#+name: position-momentum-operator
#+begin_src sage
  R.<x> = QQbar[]
  W = DifferentialWeylAlgebra(R)
  (x, dx) = W.gens()
  p = -i*dx
#+end_src

Having this we can define the Hamiltonian $H$ of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator
and the corresponding annihilation ($a$), and creation operator ($a^\dagger$):

#+name: commutator-ladder-operators
#+begin_src sage
  H = p^2 / 2 + x^2 / 2

  a = (x + i*p) / sqrt(2)
  ad = (x - i*p) / sqrt(2)
#+end_src

Some basic sanity checks:

#+name: commutator-ladder-operators-checks
#+begin_src sage :results replace :tangle no cache: yes
  assert com(x, p) == i
  assert com(a, ad) == 1
  "PASSED"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: commutator-ladder-operators-checks
: 'PASSED'

Note that from [[unitless-position-and-momentum][above]] we get

<<unitless-hamiltonian-and-annihilator>>
$$
  \tilde{H} = \hbar\omega H, \quad \tilde{a} = a .
$$

For convenience let us also define the number operator $N=a^\dagger a = H-1/2$. Clearly
the number operator has the same eigenstates as $H$. The corresponding eigenvalues are
shifted by $1/2$.

<<spectrum-harmonic-oscillator-1d>>
- Theorem (Spectrum of 1D Harmonic Oscillator) :: Let

  $$ \ket{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2 / 2} , $$

  and

  $$ \ket{n} = \frac{(a^\dagger)^n}{\sqrt{n!}} \ket{0} , $$

  for $n\in\{1,2,\ldots\}$. These states form an orthonormal set of the Hilbert space
  $L^2 (\RR)$ of square integrable functions. Moreover they are eigenstates of $H$ and $N$
  with $N\ket{n}=n\ket{n}$.
  - Remark :: <<gaussian-integral>> It is well known that the gaussian function which
    defines $\ket{0}$ is already normalized (see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral][gaussian integral]]).
  - Proof :: See [[#exercise-7.4-proof][solution of exercise 7.4]].
* Exercises
** Exercise 7.1
Using the fact that $x$ and $p$ do not commute, and that in fact $[x,p]=\ii\,\hbar$,
explicitly show that $a^\dagger\,a=H/\hbar\omega-1/2$.

*** Solution
This is just boring algebra which can be done much faster (and more reliably) by /sage/:

#+name: exercise-7.1
#+begin_src sage :results replace :tangle no :cache yes
  assert ad * a == H - 1/2
  "PASSED"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[39888cccfad91cfa7dfd76c46743e018e631a159]: exercise-7.1
: 'PASSED'

** Exercise 7.2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: exercise-7.2
:END:
Given that $[x,p]=\ii\,\hbar$, compute $[a,a^\dagger]$.

*** Solution
The unitless result is $1$:

#+name: exercise-7.2
#+begin_src sage :results replace :tangle no :cache yes
  com(a, ad)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[78c440463e894f8531e28cce10a7a932478e9b08]: exercise-7.2
: 1

Since the [[unitless-hamiltonian-and-annihilator][creator/annihilator is already unit-less]] the same is true with units.

** Exercise 7.3
Compute $[H,a]$ and use the result to show that if $\ket{\psi}$ is an eigenstate of $H$
with energy $E\geq n\hbar\omega$, then $a^n\ket{\psi}$ is an eigenstate with energy
$E-n\hbar\omega$.

*** Solution
Using $[a^\dagger,a]=-[a,a^\dagger]=-1$ (see [[#exercise-7.2][exercise 7.2]]) we deduce (assuming unit-less quantities)

$$
  [H,a] = [a^\dagger a, a] = (a^\dagger a - a a^\dagger) a = [a^\dagger,a] a = -a .
$$

Using this we get

\begin{align*}
  H a^n \ket{\psi} &= (Ha) a^{n-1} \ket{\psi} \\
  &= ([H,a] + aH)a^{n-1} \ket{\psi} \\
  &= (-a^n + a H a^{n-1}) \ket{\psi} \\
  &= a H a^{n-1} \ket{\psi} - a^n \ket{\psi} .
\end{align*}

Recall that we want to show that $Ha^n\ket{\psi}=(E-n)a^n\ket{\psi}$ for all natural
numbers $n\leq E$. Using the above calculation we can prove this by induction. In fact,
for $n=0$ the assertion is trivial. For $n>0$ we may use the above calculation together
with the assertion for $n-1$:

$$
  H a^n \ket{\psi} = a(E-n+1)a^{n-1}\ket{\psi} - a^n \ket{\psi} = (E-n)a^n\ket{\psi} .
$$

QED.

** Exercise 7.4
Show that $\ket{n}=\frac{(a^\dagger)^n}{\sqrt{n!}}\ket{0}$.

*** Proof
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: exercise-7.4-proof
:END:

The exercise statement is rather "vague" (I try to be friendly here ðŸ˜‰), so let us prove
some definite statement like the [[spectrum-harmonic-oscillator-1d][theorem about the spectrum of the harmonic oscillator]]
instead.

To find the /ground state/ consider

$$
  \bra{\phi} N \ket{\phi} = \norm{a\phi}^2 \geq 0 .
$$

Equality holds iff

$$
  x \phi(x) + \phi'(x) = \sqrt{2} \cdot (a\phi)(x) = 0 .
$$

This is a linear ordinary differential equation. One solution is given by
$x\mapsto\exp(-x^2/2)$, which can be easily checked by plugging this in. We do not need
this fact (since it follows automatically later on) but the solution is unique up to a
scalar factor, which can be seen by observing that the ODE is equivalent to
$\partial_x\log(\phi(x))=-x$.

The factor $1/\sqrt{2\pi}$ in the definition of $\ket{0}$ [[gaussian-integral][ensures normalization]]. We thus
proved $N\ket{0}=0$. Next let us verify that $\ket{n}$ is an eigenvector. To simplify the
notation let us define $\ket{n'}:=\sqrt{n!}\ket{n}$.

$$
  N\ket{n'} = a^\dagger a (a^\dagger)^n \ket{0} .
$$

By using $[a,a^\dagger]=1$ ([[*Exercise 7.2][exercise 7.2]]) we may move the single $a$ to the right and then
use $a\ket{0}=0$ (this procedure is just simple example of mathematical induction). This
leads to

$$
  N\ket{n'} = n (a^\dagger)^n \ket{0} = n \ket{n'} ,
$$

hence establishing that $\ket{n'}$ (and $\ket{n}$) is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue
$n$. To see that the $1/\sqrt{n!}$ in the definition of $\ket{n}$ is indeed the right
normalization factor use the freshly proved equality $N\ket{n'}=n\ket{n'}$ and consider
(don't forget $[a,a^\dagger]=1$)

$$
  \norm{(n+1)'}^2 = \bra{n'} a a^\dagger \ket{n'}
  = \bra{n'} N + 1 \ket{n'}
  = (n+1) \norm{n'}^2 .
$$

Hence, since $\ket{0}$ is already normalized mathematical induction shows that $\ket{n}$
is normalized too.

It remains to show that the $(\ket{n})$ generate the whole Hilbert space (completeness),
since orthogonality already follows from the fact that they are eigenstates to /different/
eigenvalues of some (unbounded) self-adjoint operator. This essentially boils down to show
that finite linear combinations of the eigenstates are dense in $L^2(\RR)$.

We only sketch the proof since this reaches out to other parts of mathematics. First of
all observe that

$$
  \ket{n}(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \; p_n(x) \; e^{-x^2/2} ,
$$

where the $p_n(x)$ are polynomials which satisfy the recursive relation

$$ p_{n+1}(x)=(2x+\partial_x)p_n(x), \quad p_0(x) = 1 . $$

These are the well-known [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials][hermite polynomials]]. From the recursive relation we directly see
(inductively) the /for our purpose important/ property that $p_n$ has degree $n$ (with
leading factor $2^n$). The density now follows from the following well known results

1. <<ex-7.4-mollification>> The compactly supported continuous functions are dense in
   $L^2(\RR)$. I do not have a good resource on that but one way to see this is by a
   method called /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollifier][mollification]]/.
2. <<ex-7.4-weierstrass-approx>> For any finite interval $I$ the polynomials on that
   interval are dense in the continuous function on $I$ with respect to the
   $L^\infty$-norm which is stronger than the $L^2$ norm (since the interval is
   finite). This is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem][Stone-Weierstrass Theorem]].

By [[ex-7.4-weierstrass-approx]] finite linear combinations of eigenstates can approximate any
compactly supported continuous function. Here it is important that any degree is
represented among the eigenstates. It should be obvious that the factor $e^{-x^2/2}$ does
not disturb this argument at all. Now completeness directly follows from
[[ex-7.4-mollification]]. QED.

** Exercise 7.5
Verify that Equations (7.11) and (7.12) are consistent with (7.10) and the normalization
condition $\norm{\ket{n}}^2=1$.

*** Solution
It is not hard to see that (7.11) and (7.12) imply (7.10):

$$
  a^\dagger a \ket{n} = a^\dagger \sqrt{n} \ket{n-1} = n \ket{n} .
$$

The normalization condition is not relevant here. So it is indeed true that it is
consistent with the three equations but for trivial reasons.

** Exercise 7.6 (Eigenstates of photon annihilation)
Prove that a coherent state is an eigenstate of the photon annihilation operator, that is,
show $a\ket{\alpha}=\lambda\ket{\alpha}$ for some constant $\lambda$.

*** Proof
Recall that $a\ket{n}=\sqrt{n}\ket{n-1}$ for $n\geq1$ and $a\ket{0}=0$. Hence

$$
  a\ket{\alpha} = e^{-\abs{\alpha}/2} \sum_n \frac{\alpha^n}{\sqrt{n}} \, a \, \ket{n}
  = e^{-\abs{\alpha}/2} \sum_n \frac{\alpha^{n+1}}{\sqrt{n}} \ket{n}
  = \alpha \ket{\alpha} .
$$

The claim follows with $\lambda=\alpha$. QED.

** Exercise 7.7
Show that the circuit below transforms a dual-rail state by

$$
  \ket{\psi_{\mathrm{out}}} = \begin{bmatrix} e^{\ii\pi} & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \ket{\psi_{\mathrm{in}}} .
$$

if we take the top wire to represent the $\ket{01}$ mode, and $\ket{10}$ the bottom mode,
and the boxed $\pi$ to represent a phase shift by $\pi$.

- Remark :: The book contains a picture showing the circuit.

*** Solution
By definition the circuit acts like this (we use $e^{\ii\pi}=-1$ to simplify notation):

$$
  \ket{0_L} = \ket{01} \mapsto -\ket{0_L}, \quad
  \ket{1_L} = \ket{10} \mapsto \ket{1_L}.
$$

The matrix representing this linear transformation with respect to the basis
$(\ket{0_L},\ket{1_L})$ (the order is important) is

\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}

as desired.

** Exercise 7.8
Show that $P\ket{\alpha}=\ket{\alpha e^{\ii\Delta}}$ where $\ket{\alpha}$ is a coherent
state (note that, in general, $\alpha$ is a complex number!).

*** Proof
The phase shift operator is given by $P\ket{n}=e^{\ii n\Delta}\ket{n}$. Hence, using $\abs{e^{\ii\Delta}}=1$

$$
P\ket{\alpha} = e^{-\abs{\alpha}^2/2} \sum_n \frac{\alpha^n \, e^{\ii n\Delta}}{\sqrt{n!}} \ket{n}
= \ket{\alpha e^{\ii\Delta}} .
$$

QED.
