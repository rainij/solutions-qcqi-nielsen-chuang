* Exercises
** Exercise 9.1
What is the trace distance between the probability distribution $(1,0)$ and the probability
distribution $(1/2,1/2)$? Between $(1/2,1/3,1/6)$ and $(3/4,1/8,1/8)$?

*** Solution
We have

$$
  D((1,0), (1/2,1/2)) = \frac{1}{2} ( 1/2 + 1/2 ) = \frac{1}{2} ,
$$

and

$$
  D((1/2,1/3,1/6), (3/4,1/8,1/8)) = \frac{1}{2} ( 1/4 + 5/24 + 1/24 ) = \frac{1}{4} .
$$

** Exercise 9.2
Show that the trace distance between probability distributions $(p,1-p)$ and $(q,1-q)$ is
$\abs{p-q}$.

*** Proof
$$
  D((p,1-p), (q, 1-q)) = \frac{1}{2} (\abs{p-q} + \abs{1-p-1+q}) = \abs{p-q} .
$$

QED.

** Exercise 9.3
What is the fidelity of the probability distributions $(1,0)$ and $(1/2,1/2)$? Of
$(1/2,1/3,1/6)$ and $(3/4,1/8,1/8)$?

*** Solution
We have

$$
  F((1,0), (1/2,1/2)) = \sqrt{1\cdot1/2} + 0 = \sqrt{2\inv}
$$

and

$$
  F((1/2,1/3,1/6), (3/4,1/8,1/8)) = \sqrt{3/8} + \sqrt{1/24} + \sqrt{1/48}
  = \frac{1 + 4\sqrt{2}}{4\sqrt{3}} \approx 0.961 .
$$

** Exercise 9.4
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
Prove (9.3):

$$
  D(p, q) = \max_S \abs{p(S)-q(S)} = \max_S \abs{\sum_{x\in S} (p_x - q_x)} .
$$

*** Proof
Let $J$ be the index set of the probability distribution (I mean: when we write $p_x$ the
$x$ is from $J$). For a set $S\subset\?J$ let $s$ be its 0-1-encoding, that is, $s_x=1$
iff $x\in\?S$. Clearly $p(S)=p\cdot s$ if we write $p\cdot\?s=\sum_xp_xs_x$. Let us
calculate:

\begin{align*}
  \max_S \abs{p(S) - q(S)} &= \max_s \abs{(p-q)\cdot s} \\
  &= \max_s \abs{(p-q)\cdot (s - 2\inv)} \\
  &= \max_t \abs{(p-q)\cdot t} \\
  &\leq \norm{p-q}_1 \cdot \max \abs{t} \\
  &= D(p, q) .
\end{align*}

Here the $\max_t$ runs over all $t$ with $t_x=\pm2\inv$ and $\norm{p-q}_1=D(p,q)$ is the
L1-norm. For the second equality we used that $\sum_xp_x=\sum_xq_x=1$. Note that the
inequality is just a basic version of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6lder's_inequality][HÃ¶lder's inequality]] (which can be seen directly of
course). Equality clearly holds for

$$
  t_x = \begin{cases} +2\inv & \text{for } p_x \geq q_x \\ -2\inv & \text{else.} \end{cases} .
$$

Equivalently (using the bijection $t=s-2\inv$):

$$
  s_x = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{for } p_x \geq q_x \\ 0 & \text{else.} \end{cases} .
$$

Note that one could also invert the cases (and treat $p_x=q_x$ arbitrarily) but this
choice also shows that one can leave out the absolute values from the procedure. QED.

** Exercise 9.5
Show that the absolute value signs may be removed from Equation (9.3), that is,

$$
  D(p, q) = \max_S (p(S)-q(S)) = \max_S \left(\sum_{x\in S} (p_x - q_x)\right) .
$$

*** Proof
This statement was already proved in the solution of [[#exercise-9.4][exercise 9.4]].
