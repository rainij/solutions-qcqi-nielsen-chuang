<h4 id="chapter-8-bloch-M-c">Derivation of the formula for \(M_{jk}\) and \(c_k\)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-chapter-8-bloch-M-c">
<p>
For convenience I provide a derivation of formulas (8.91) and (8.92) for the
representation of a quantum operation on a single-qubit principal system:
</p>

\begin{align*}
  M_{jk} &= \sum_l \left[
    a_{lj} a_{lk}^* + a_{lj}^* a_{lk} +
    \left(\abs{\alpha_l}^2 - \sum_p \abs{a_{lp}}^2 \right) \delta_{jk} +
    \ii \sum_p \epsilon_{jkp} (\alpha_l a_{lp}^* - \alpha_l^* a_{lp})
  \right] , \\
  c_k &= 2 \ii \sum_l \sum_{jp} \epsilon_{jpk} a_{lj} a_{lp}^* .
\end{align*}

<p>
Here we assume that the operation elements look as follows:
</p>

<p>
\[
  E_l = \alpha_l + \sum_{k=1}^3 a_{lk} \sigma_k ,
\]
</p>

<p>
and satisfy the trace-preserving property \(\sum_lE_l^\dagger\?E_l=1\) (here and in the
following I write scalars in place of multiples of the identity matrix). Let
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho = \frac{1}{2} (1 + r_k \sigma_k) .
\]
</p>

<p>
Throughout this section (about Bloch sphere) let us apply a variant of <b>Einsteins
summation convention</b>. Whenever a free index appears twice in a <i>product expression</i> we
sum over it. For example, the above formula for \(\rho\) means
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho = \frac{1}{2} (1 + \sum_k r_k \sigma_k) .
\]
</p>

<p>
As a special case we implicitly read \(\abs{x_i}^2\) as \(x_ix_i^*\) and hence imply summation
over \(i\) in case of a square of an absolute value too. Let us start by considering the
trace-preserving condition
</p>

<p>
\[
  1 = E_l^\dagger E_l = (\alpha_l^* + a_{lp}^*\sigma_p) (\alpha_l + a_{lp}\sigma_q)
  = \abs{\alpha_l}^2 + \alpha_l^* a_{lp} \sigma_p + \alpha_l a_{lp}^* \sigma_p + a_{lp}^*a_{lp} \sigma_p \sigma_q .
\]
</p>

<p>
Note that \(\sigma_p\sigma_q=\ii\epsilon_{pqk}\sigma_k+\delta_{pq}\). Hence
</p>

<p>
\[
  1 = \abs{\alpha_l}^2 + \abs{a_{lp}}^2 +
    2\Re(\alpha_la_{lk}^*)\sigma_k + \ii\epsilon_{pqk} a_{lp}^* a_{lq} \sigma_k .
\]
</p>

<p>
We can deduce the two constraints the coefficients \(\alpha\) and \(a\) have to satisfy in
order for the trace-preserving property to hold (we use here that the Pauli operators
together with the identity are a (orthonormal) basis of \(\CC^{2\times2}\)):
</p>

<p>
<a id="org9c92a6e"></a>
\[
  \abs{\alpha_l}^2 + \abs{a_{lp}}^2 = 1 ,
\]
</p>

<p>
and
</p>

<p>
<a id="orgfed231a"></a>
\[
  \forall k: \; \ii\epsilon_{pqk} a_{lp}^* a_{lq} = -2\Re(\alpha_la_{lk}^*) .
\]
</p>

<p>
Now consider
</p>

<p>
\[
  2 \calE(\rho) =
  2 E_l \rho E_l^\dagger = (\alpha_l + a_{lp}\sigma_p) (1 + r_k \sigma_k) (\alpha_l^* + a_{lq}^*\sigma_q)
  =: I_1 + I_2 ,
\]
</p>

<p>
where the \(I_1\) corresponds to the \(1\) in the middle factor and \(I_2\) to the \(r_k\sigma_k\)
in the middle factor. In case you wonder: the factor of \(2\) at the front should make the
expression a bit simpler by avoiding numerous factors \(1/2\) in the following.
</p>

\begin{align*}
  I_1 &= \abs{\alpha_l}^2 + \alpha_l a_{lp}^* \sigma_p + \alpha_l^* a_{lp} \sigma_p +
    a_{lp}a_{lq}^* \sigma_p\sigma_q \\
  &= \abs{\alpha_l}^2 + \abs{a_{lp}}^2 + 2\Re(\alpha_la_{lk}^*)\sigma_k
    + \ii\epsilon_{pqk} a_{lp} a_{lq}^* \sigma_k \\
  &= 1 + 2\ii \epsilon_{pqk} a_{lp} a_{lq}^* \sigma_k .
\end{align*}

<p>
For the last equality we used the <a href="#org9c92a6e">first</a> and <a href="#orgfed231a">second</a> formula for the
trace-preservation. Since \(I_1\) contains the part of \(2\calE(\rho)=1+r_k'\sigma_k\) which
does not depend on on the \(r_k\) we already proved the formula for \(c_k\). The treatment of
\(I_2\) is a bit more involved.
</p>

\begin{align*}
  I_2 &= \abs{\alpha_l}^2 r_k \sigma_k +
    \alpha_l a_{lp}^* r_k \sigma_k\sigma_p + \alpha_l^* a_{lp} r_k \sigma_p\sigma_k +
    a_{lp} a_{lq}^* r_k \sigma_p \sigma_k \sigma_q \\
  &= \abs{\alpha_l}^2 r_k \sigma_k +
    \alpha_l a_{lp}^* r_k (\ii\epsilon_{kpj}\sigma_j + \delta_{kp}) +
    \alpha_l^* a_{lp} r_k (-\ii\epsilon_{kpj}\sigma_j + \delta_{kp}) +
    a_{lp} a_{lq}^* r_k \sigma_p \sigma_k \sigma_q \\
  &=: I_{20} + I_{21} + I_{22} .
\end{align*}

<p>
Here \(I_{22}\) stands for the last summand (the product of three Paulis), \(I_{21}\) stands for
the two commands involving the \(\delta_{kp}\). Finally \(I_{20}\) is the rest. Note that
\(I_{20}\) already corresponds to terms appearing in the formula for \(M_{jk}\) and hence
needs no further treatment. We have
</p>

<p>
\[
  I_{21} = \alpha_l a_{lk}^* r_k + \alpha_l^* a_{lk} r_k
  = 2 \Re(\alpha_l a_{lk}^*) r_k .
\]
</p>

<p>
Note that this term cannot have any possible correspondence in \(M\) (or \(c\)). Hence we
expect it to be cancelled by \(I_{22}\). Therefore let us finally consider \(I_{22}\). Note
that
</p>

<p>
\[
  \sigma_p \sigma_k \sigma_q = - \sigma_p \sigma_q \sigma_k + 2 \sigma_p \delta_{qk} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Hence
</p>

<p>
\[
  I_{22} = (- a_{lp} a_{lq}^* \sigma_p\sigma_q) r_k\sigma_k + 2 a_{lp} a_{lk}^* r_k \sigma_p
  =: J_1 + J_2 .
\]
</p>

<p>
Moreover
</p>

<p>
\[
  J_1 = (-\abs{a_{lp}}^2 - \ii\epsilon_{pqs}a_{lp}a_{lq}^* \sigma_s) r_k\sigma_k
  = -\abs{a_{lp}}^2 r_k\sigma_k - \ii\epsilon_{pqk}a_{lp}a_{lq}^* -
    \ii \epsilon_{pqs} a_{lp}a_{lq}^* \sigma_s (r_p \sigma_p + r_q \sigma_q)
  =: J_{10} + J_{11} + J_{12} .
\]
</p>

<p>
For the second equality I splitted the summation over \(k\) into \(k=s\) and \(k\neq\?s\) (this
leads to a tiny clash with out summation convention but shouldn't be a major hurdle for
understanding the calculations). Note that \(J_{10}\) corresponds to a term in \(M\), so with
this one we are done. By <a href="#orgfed231a">trace-preservation</a> we have that
</p>

<p>
\[
  J_{11} + I_{21} = 0 ,
\]
</p>

<p>
which is the awaited cancellation for \(I_{21}\). So these terms are also done. Recall that
the only still open terms are \(J_{12}\) and \(J_2\). We will go on with the former.
</p>

<p>
\[
  J_{12} = -\ii a_{lp} a_{lq}^* \left( \epsilon_{pqs}
    \left[ r_p \ii \epsilon_{spq}\sigma_q + r_q \ii \epsilon_{sqp}\sigma_p \right] \right)
  = a_{lp} a_{lq}^* (r_p\sigma_q - r_q \sigma_p) .
\]
</p>

<p>
This can be nicely combined with \(J_2\):
</p>

<p>
\[
  J_{12} + J_2 = a_{lp} a_{lq}^* r_p \sigma_q + a_{lp} a_{lq}^* r_q \sigma_p
  = a_{lk} a_{lj}^* r_k \sigma_j + a_{lj} a_{lk}^* r_k \sigma_j ,
\]
</p>

<p>
which yields the remaining terms in the formula for \(M\). QED.

<p>
For some exercises I think it is convenient to be able to perform (possibly
non-trace-preserving) single qubit operations. For this the Bloch sphere is not sufficient
anymore, but we still have a representation in \(\RR^4\) (see my solution of <a href="#exercise-8.16">exercise
8.16</a>). More precisely on the real subspace of \(\CC^{2\times2}\) generated by the
Pauli-operators \((I,X,Y,Z)\).

This is a really basic question and it should actually be obvious <i>if</i> you really
understand the bra-ket notation (beware however that it might <i>appear</i> to be obvious if
you merely feel <i>familiar</i> with it).
</p>

<p>
To give a meaningful solution beyond "it is obvious" we take a step back and recall what
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation">bra-ket</a> notation actually means. In quantum mechanics we always work on (complex)
Hilbert spaces. A Hilbert space is a (complex) vector space \(\calH\) equipped with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesquilinear_form">sesquilinear form</a>, which has to obey certain axioms to be mentioned soon. We denote it by
</p>

<p>
\[
  (\ket{\psi}, \ket{\varphi}) .
\]
</p>

<p>
A sesquilinear form is a mapping \(\calH\times\calH\to\CC\) which is linear in the second
argument and conjugate-linear in the first argument. For a Hilbert space we require in
addition that (<b>positivity</b>)
</p>

<p>
\[
  \forall \ket{\psi} \in \calH\backslash\{0\}: \; (\ket{\psi}, \ket{\psi}) > 0 ,
\]
</p>

<p>
and that (<b>symmetry</b>)
</p>

<p>
\[
  \forall \ket{\psi}, \ket{\varphi} \in \calH : \; (\ket{\psi},\ket{\varphi})
  = \overline{(\ket{\varphi},\ket{\psi})} .
\]
</p>

<p>
(The bar means <i>complex conjugation</i>.) Such a sesquilinear form is called a <b>scalar
product</b>. This is what makes a complex <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space">Hilbert space</a></i>, a complex vector space equipped
with a scalar product. There are also real Hilbert spaces but we do not need them
here. Note that we are always talking about <i>finite</i> dimensional vector spaces. In case of
infinite dimensional vector spaces a <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_metric_space">completeness</a></b> axiom is required in addition. (In the
finite dimensional case this axiom follows automatically from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_of_the_real_numbers">completeness</a> axiom of
real (and hence complex) numbers).
</p>

<p>
In the framework of Dirac's bra-ket notation the kets are just the elements of the Hilbert
space. We already used this in the above introduction. The bras are elements of the <i>dual
space</i> \(\calH^*\) which is just the space of linear maps \(\calH\to\CC\). For any
\(\ket{\psi}\in\calH\) an example of such a map is given by
</p>

<p>
\[
  \ket{\varphi} \mapsto (\ket{\psi}, \ket{\varphi}) .
\]
</p>

<p>
<a id="org8bca372"></a> In fact, one can prove that any element of \(\calH^*\) (that
is, any linear map \(\calH\to\CC\)) can be written like this for a <i>unique</i>
\(\ket{\psi}\). This is called the <b>canonical isomorphism</b> between \(\calH\) and \(\calH^*\) (it
is called <i>canonical</i> since we could define it without knowing anything concrete about our
Hilbert space, in other words it is definable in the most abstract terms). Note that the
canonical isomorphism \(\iota\) is <i>conjugate</i> linear, that is,
\(\iota(\lambda\ket{\psi})=\bra{\psi}\lambda^*\).
</p>

<p>
This canonical isomorphism actually motivates the bras. A bra \(\bra{\psi}\in\calH^*\) is
the linear map given by
</p>

<p>
\[
  \bra{\psi} : \; \ket{\varphi} \mapsto \sprod{\psi}{\varphi} := (\ket{\psi}, \ket{\varphi}) .
\]
</p>

<p>
Having said that, terms like
</p>

<p>
\[
  \bra{\psi} U \ket{\varphi}
\]
</p>

<p>
are the same as
</p>

<p>
\[
  \bra{\psi} U \ket{\varphi} = (\bra{\psi}\circ U) \ket{\varphi} = (\ket{\psi}, U\ket{\varphi}) ,
\]
</p>

<p>
where \(\circ\) denotes the composition of functions (\(U\) and \(\bra{\psi}\) as linear maps
are both functions of course). And of course, the bra-ket notation also makes the above
introduced notation for the scalar product obsolete since basically the bra and the ket
are the left and right half of the scalar product.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8755f16" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org8755f16">The actual proof</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org8755f16">
<p>
Let us return to the actual exercise. We use the above notation \((\ldots,\ldots)\) for the
scalar product to make the derivation clearer. Let \(U\) be a unitary operator on \(\calH\)
and let
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho = \rho_{\ket{\psi}} = \proj{\psi} .
\]
</p>

<p>
The task is to calculate \(\rho_{U\ket{\psi}}\) and to show that it is equal to
\(\calE(\rho_{\ket{\psi}})\). Note that \(\rho\) is a linear map \(\calH\to\calH\) given by
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho \ket{\varphi} = \ket{\psi} \sprod{\psi}{\varphi} = (\ket{\psi}, \ket{\varphi}) \ket{\varphi} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Hence
</p>

\begin{align*}
  \rho_{U\ket{\psi}} \ket{\varphi} &= (U\ket{\psi}, \ket{\varphi}) U\ket{\psi} \\
  &= (\ket{\psi}, U^\dagger\ket{\varphi}) U\ket{\psi} \\
  &= \bra{\psi} U^\dagger \ket{\varphi} U\ket{\psi} \\
  &= U\ket{\psi} \bra{\psi} U^\dagger \ket{\varphi} \\
  &= U\rho_{\ket{\psi}} U^\dagger \ket{\varphi} .
\end{align*}

<p>
The first equality follows from the definition of \(\rho_{\ket{\psi}}\). The second one
follows from the definition of the (hermitian) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_adjoint">adjoint</a> operator. The third one is the
definition of the bras. The fourth equality just moves the complex number
\(\bra{\psi}U\ket{\varphi}\) to the right. The last equation is again the definition of
\(\rho_{\ket{\psi}}\).
</p>

<p>
Since the above eqation holds for all \(\varphi\) we have
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho_{U\ket{\psi}} = U\rho_{\ket{\psi}} U^\dagger .
\]
</p>

<p>
QED.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Remark</dt><dd><p>
There is another slightly deeper way to see this result. Let us denote the
above mentioned <a href="#org8bca372">canonical isomorphism</a> by
</p>

<p>
\[
  \iota(\ket{\psi}) = \bra{\psi} .
  \]
</p>

<p>
It is not hard to show and extension of the conjugate-linearity property of the
canonical isomorphism:
</p>

<p>
\[
  \iota(U\ket{\psi}) = \iota(\ket{\psi}) U^\dagger = \bra{\psi} U^\dagger .
  \]
</p>

<p>
In fact, the proof is even shorter than the proof of the claim of the exercise. That is,
the <i>canonical</i> way to associate a linear mapping \(\calH^*\to\calH^*\) with \(U\) is the
right composition with \(U^\dagger\). From this the claim of the exercise follows too.

<h3 id="org9c53e59">Exercise 8.2 (Measurement as a quantum operation)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9c53e59">
<p>
Recall from Section 2.2.3 (on page 84) that a quantum measurement with outcomes labeled by
\(m\) is described by a set of measurement operators \(M_m\) such that
\(\sum_mM_m^\dagger\,M_m=I\). Let the state of the system immediately before the measurement
be \(\rho\). Show that for \(\calE_m(\rho)=M_m\rho\,M_m^\dagger\), the state of the system
immediately after the measurement is
</p>

<p>
\[
  \frac{\calE_m(\rho)}{\trace{\calE_m(\rho)}} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Also show that the probability of obtaining this measurement result is
\(p(m)=\trace{\calE_m(\rho)}\).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc5883d6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc5883d6">Solution</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc5883d6">
<p>
Clearly the exercise assumes that we only know the postulates of quantum mechanics for
<i>pure</i> states as detailed in section 2.2.3 and not the generalization to mixed states as
detailed in 2.4.1. Otherwise the exercise would be a trivial restatement of the evolution
and measurement postulates.
</p>

<p>
Let us first assume that \(\rho=\proj{\psi}\) is a pure state (just expressed as a density
matrix). In order to compute the trace of an operator \(\sigma\) we can take <i>any</i>
orthonormal basis \(\{e\}\) and have \(\trace{\sigma}=\sum_{e}\bra{e}\sigma\ket{e}\). Let
\(\sigma=\proj{\nu}\) with a not necessarily normalized non-zero \(\ket{\nu}\). Without loss
of generality we may assume that \(\ket{\nu}/\norm{\nu}\) is part of our chosen ONB (this
follows from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process">Gram-Schmidt</a> procedure). Hence
</p>

<p>
<a id="org7a1f08a"></a>
\[
  \trace{\sigma} = \sum_{e} \bra{e}\proj{\nu}\ket{e}
  = \sprod{\nu}{\nu} \sprod{\nu}{\nu} / \norm{\nu}^2
  = \norm{\nu}^2 .
\]
</p>

<p>
Given a state \(\ket{\psi}\) the post measurement state after measuring \(m\) is
\(M_m\ket{\psi}/\norm{M_m\ket{\psi}}\). From the reasoning in <a href="#exercise-8.1">exercise 1</a> (that \(U\) was a
unitary operator didn't really matter there) we deduce that the corresponding density
matrix is
</p>

<p>
\[
  \frac{M_m \rho M_m^\dagger}{\norm{M_m\ket{\psi}}^2} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Using <a href="#org7a1f08a">the equation</a> involving \(\sigma\) (with \(\ket{\nu}=M_m\ket{\psi}\)) we see that
\(\norm{M_m\ket{\psi}}^2=\trace{M_m\rho\,M_m^\dagger}\). Hence the post measurement state is
</p>

<p>
\[
  \frac{M_m \rho M_m^\dagger}{\trace{M_m\rho M_m^\dagger}} .
\]
</p>

<p>
The probability to measure \(m\) (and to obtain this state) is
</p>

<p>
\[
  p(m) = \norm{M_m\ket{\psi}}^2 = \trace{M_m \rho M_m^\dagger} .
\]
</p>

<p>
This concludes the exercise for pure states. Let \(\rho\) be a mixed state now. This means
that there is a decomposition
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho = \sum_j p_j \proj{\psi_j}
\]
</p>

<p>
with strictly positive coefficients \(p_j\) such that \(\sum_jp_j=1\). The ensemble
interpretation says that having such a mixed state means that, upon measurement, one of
the pure states \(\ket{\psi_j}\) is taken at random with probability \(p_j\) and then the
measurement proceeds as in the pure state case. It is not a-priori clear that this is well
defined since the decomposition of \(\rho\) into pure states is not unique (c.f. Theorem 2.6
on page 103). But let us ignore this for the moment. We will see that the obtained
probabilities and the post measurement states are independent of the concrete
decomposition, hence the problem solves itself.
</p>

<p>
According to the ensemble interpretation the probability to measure \(m\) is
</p>

<p>
\[
  p(m) = \sum_j p(m|j) \, p_j = \sum_j \trace{M_m\proj{\psi_j} M_m^\dagger} \, p_j
  = \trace{M_m \rho M_m^\dagger} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Here
</p>

<p>
\[
  p(m|j) = \norm{M_m \ket{\psi_j}}^2 = \trace{M_m \proj{\psi_j} M_m^\dagger}
\]
</p>

<p>
is the conditioned probability to measure \(m\) if we already know that the pure state
\(\psi_j\) was chosen. Suppose we know that we measured \(m\). What is the (mixed) state in
that case? We already know that with (conditioned) probability \(p(j|m)\) the post
measurement state is
</p>

<p>
\[
  \frac{M_m\proj{\psi_j} M_m^\dagger}{p(m|j)} .
\]
</p>

<p>
But this is an ensemble of pure states! Hence, using \(p(m|j)p_j=p(m\cap\,j)=p(j|m)p(m)\),
the corresponding mixed state is
</p>

<p>
\[
  \sum_j p(j|m) \frac{M_m\proj{\psi_j} M_m^\dagger}{p(m|j)}
  = \frac{1}{p(m)} \sum_j p_j M_m\proj{\psi_j} M_m^\dagger
  = \frac{M_m\rho M_m^\dagger}{p(m)}
  = \frac{M_m\rho M_m^\dagger}{\trace{M_m\rho M_m^\dagger}} .
\]
</p>

<p>
This concludes the exercise. But let is briefly mention that in case we do <i>not</i> obtain
the outcome of the measurement the post measurement state is
</p>

<p>
<a id="orgdc29775"></a>
\[
  \sum_{m,j} p(m|j) p_j \, \frac{M_m \proj{\psi_j} M_m^\dagger}{p(m|j)}
  = \sum_m M_m \rho M_m^\dagger .
\]
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Remark</dt><dd><p>
Together with the conclusions from the actual exercise we can draw the
following additional conclusion: If now we somehow obtain the measurement result than
<a href="#orgdc29775">this sum</a> "collapses" into one of its summands (just normalized), with probability
\(\trace{M_m\rho\,M_m^\dagger}\) for each of them. That is, the measurement can be
decomposed into two parts: First the state changes to
</p>

<p>
\[
    \calE(\rho) = \sum_m \calE_m(\rho)
  \]
</p>

<p>
and then (if we obtain the measurement result) the state "collapses" into
\(\calE_m(\rho)/\trace{\calE_m(\rho)}\) for one of the \(m\) with probability
\(\trace{\calE_m(\rho)}\). So, the first part of the measurement can be expressed in terms
of quantum operations. But not the second part (since it is not deterministic and cannot
give rise to a mathematical function on density matrices).

Our derivation of the operator-sum representation implicitly assumed that the input and
output spaces for the operation were the same. Suppose a composite system AB initially in
an unknown quantum state \(\rho\) is brought into contact with a composite system CD initially in
some standard state \(\ket{0}\), and the two systems interact according to a unitary interaction
\(U\). After the interaction we discard systems A and D, leaving a state \(\rho'\) of system
BC. Show that the map \(\calE(\rho)=\rho'\) satisfies

\[
  \calE(\rho) = \sum_k E_k \rho E_k^\dagger ,

for some set of linear operators \(E_k\) from the state space of system AB to the state
space of system BC, and such that \(\sum_kE_k^\dagger\,E_k\).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org768fbd6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org768fbd6">Proof</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org768fbd6">
<p>
Basically we do the same as the book for the special case of equal input and output
space. According to the exercise we have
</p>

<p>
\[
  \calE(\rho) = \ptrace{AD}{U \rho \otimes \proj{0} U^\dagger} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Let \(\{e_k\}\) be an orthonormal basis of AD. Hence
</p>

<p>
\[
  \calE(\rho) = \sum_k \bra{e_k} U \rho \otimes \proj{0} U^\dagger \ket{e_k} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Thus, defining \(E_k=\bra{e_k}U\ket{0}\), we have
</p>

<p>
\[
  \calE(\rho) = \sum_k E_k \rho E_k^\dagger .
\]
</p>

<p>
That is, \(\calE\) has the required form. We only have to show the completeness property
\(J:=\sum_kE_k^\dagger\,E_k=I_{AB}\). Note that \(J=J^\dagger\) is self-adjoint and
positive-definite. Let \(\rho\) be arbitrary and consider
</p>

<p>
\[
  1 = \ptrace{BC}{\calE(\rho)} = \sum_k \ptrace{BC}{E_k\rho E_k^\dagger}
  = \sum_k \ptrace{AB}{E_k^\dagger E_k \rho}
  = \ptrace{AB}{J^\dagger \rho} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Here we used the well-known <i>cyclicity property</i> of the trace (which also holds for
(matching) rectangular matrices). Thus
</p>

<p>
<a id="org1e1b03d"></a>
\[
  \forall \rho : \; \trace{(J-I)^\dagger \rho} = 0 .
\]
</p>

<p>
Here the quantification runs over all density operators (hermitian, positive definite,
trace 1).
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Remark</dt><dd>In case you wonder why I take the adjoint of \(J\). We have that
\(S,T\mapsto\trace{S^\dagger\,T}\) turns the matrix space \(\CC^{n\times\?n}\) into a
complex Hilbert space. See e.g. the definition of a Hilbert-Schmidt operator on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%E2%80%93Schmidt_operator">wikipedia</a> (it is about infinite dimensional spaces but just note that in finite
dimensions every operator is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator). For this exercise it does not
directly help us since the quantification <a href="#org1e1b03d">above</a> is <i>not</i> over all
\(\rho\in\CC^{n\times\?n}\). But still nice to know 😉.</dd>

<p>
Considering all rank-1 density matrices \(\rho=\proj{\psi}\) we deduce

<p>
\[
  \forall \ket{\psi} : \; \trace{(J-I)^\dagger \proj{\psi}} = \bra{\psi} (J-I)^\dagger \ket{\psi} = 0 .
\]
</p>

<p>
(The first equality can either be seen by the cyclicity property of the trace or by using
an ONB which involves \(\psi\) (but normalized) as one of its elements) But this can only be
true (for all normalized \(\ket{\psi}\)) if \(J=I\). QED.

Note that \(U\) is nothing else than the <code>CNOT</code> gate. Let us label the environment by E. One
way to define the operation elements is
</p>

\begin{align*}
  E_0 &= \bra{0_E} U \ket{0_E} = P_0 \sprod{0_E}{0_E} + P_1 \bra{0_E}X\ket{0_E} = P_0 , \\

(The \(\ket{0_E}\) to the right of \(U\) comes from the initial state of the environment.)

That is, this operation acts like the first part of a measurement. It describes the state

  U^\dagger U = U^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( X^2 \otimes I + Y^2 \otimes X^2 + (XY+YX)\otimes X \right) = I .

<p>
Hence \(U\) is indeed unitary. One way to define the operation elements is as follows:
</p>

\begin{align*}
  E_0 &= \bra{0_E} U \ket{0_E} = X \sprod{0_E}{0_E} + Y \bra{0_E}X\ket{0_E} = X , \\
  E_1 &= \bra{1_E} U \ket{0_E} = X \sprod{1_E}{0_E} + Y \bra{1_E}X\ket{0_E} = Y .
\end{align*}

<p>
Hence
</p>

<p>
\[
  \calE(\rho) = \frac{1}{2} \left(X \rho X + Y \rho Y \right)
  = \begin{bmatrix} \rho_{11} & 0 \\ 0 & \rho_{00} \end{bmatrix} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Interpreting this in the same way as in <a href="#exercise-8.4">exercise 8.4</a> we deduce that \(\calE\) corresponds to
a spin-flip followed by a measurement (without obtaining the measurement outcome).

Show that \(\det(S)\) (From the polar decomposition of \(M=OS\)) need not be positive.

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Remark</dt><dd>I assume that <i>positive</i> means <i>strictly greater than zero</i> here. Sometimes
zero is included for positivity so it is always a bit unclear what is meant. There are
two reasons to see it this way:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
The <i>polar decomposition</i> explicitly states that there is an orthogonal matrix \(O\) and
a <i>positive</i> matrix \(S\) (Moreover \(S\) is unique and \(O\) is unique on the support of
\(S\)). Coincidentally here we already have a case were <i>positive</i> actually means that
\(0\) is included, because it is defined as
</p>

<p>
\[ \forall\ket{\psi}\neq0: \; \bra{\psi} S \ket{\psi} \geq 0 . \]

<p>
In particular \(S=0\), or more generally that the kernel of \(S\) is non-trivial, is a
possibility.
</p>

<p>
But <i>positivity</i> implies \(\det(S)\geq0\). Hence \(0\) can be the only violation of being
"positive". Hence the strict interpretation of "positive" in this exercise. A loop
hole would be that the exercise is somehow meant in some other way going away from the
polar decomposition.
</p></li>
<li>The second reason is that I believe that \(\det(M)\geq0\) always holds. See also my

Suppose a projective measurement is performed on a single qubit in the basis \(\ket{+}\),
\(\ket{-}\), where \(\ket{\pm}=(\ket{0}\pm\ket{1})/\sqrt{2}\). In the event that we are
ignorant of the result of the measurement, the density matrix evolves according to the
equation
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho \mapsto \calE(\rho) = \proj{+}\rho\proj{+} + \proj{-}\rho\proj{-} .
\]

We reduce this to a known problem by transforming the operation into a phase-flip. This
has the advantage that we already know what it does in the Bloch-sphere, and even if not,
it is an easier problem since we can work in the standard basis (and know for example how
the matrices of the Pauli matrices look like in that basis).
</p>

<p>
Let \(H=(X+Z)/\sqrt{2}\) be the Hadamard transform (note that \(H^\dagger=H\) and
\(H^2=1\)). Recall that it swaps \(X\) and \(Z\) as well their eigenspace projectors
(\(\ket{\pm}\) are the eigenvectors of \(X\)). Hence
</p>

<p>
\[
  \calE'(\rho) = H \calE(H\rho H) H = \proj{0}\rho\proj{0} + \proj{1}\rho\proj{1} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Note that \(\calE'\) is just the phase flip and we already know what it is. In the Bloch
sphere it corresponds to a projection onto the z-axis (see chapter 8.3.3):
</p>

<p>
\[
  M' = \diag(0, 0, 1), \; c' = 0 .
\]
</p>

<p>
In the Bloch-sphere interpretation of unitary operator \(H\) acts as a rotation around
\((\hat{x}+\hat{z})/\sqrt{2}\) by 180°. It swaps \(\hat{x}\) and \(\hat{z}\) and negates
\(\hat{y}\), that is, as a rotation in the Bloch sphere \(\rho\mapsto\?H\rho\?H\) is given by
this matrix:
</p>

<p>
\[
  T = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &  0 & 1 \\
    0 & -1 & 0 \\
    1 &  0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Hence the following describes \(\calE\):
</p>

<p>
\[
  M = TM'T = \diag(1, 0, 0), \; c = Tc' = 0 .

The graphical method for understanding single qubit quantum operations was derived for
trace-preserving quantum operations. Find an explicit example of a non-trace-preserving

Let \(E\) be an <i>arbitrary</i> linear operator on \(\CC^2\) and let us consider the following
quantum operation
</p>

<p>
\[
  \calE(\rho) = E \rho E^\dagger .
\]
</p>

<p>
Note that <i>physicality</i> (\(\trace{\calE(\rho)}\leq1\)) might be violated for some \(\rho\) but
for this exercise physicality is not really relevant. It could always be restored by
multiplication with a small \(\varepsilon\?>\?0\).
</p>

<p>
Note that from Kraus' theorem we know that an arbitrary single-qubit operation needs up to
four operation elements (c.f. <a href="#exercise-8.10">exercise 8.10</a>). We try to generalize some of our findings at
the end. But for now let us only consider the one-element case.
</p>

<p>
Normally \(\calE\) only acts on density operators, that is, operators of the form
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho = 1 + x X + y Y + z Z ,
\]
</p>

<p>
where \(x,y,z\in\RR\). <b>For notational convenience we left out the factor \(1/2\).</b> It does
not really matter for our purposes. Note that the space of such matrices is a
three-dimensional <i>real-affine</i> subspace of \(\CC^{2\times2}\equiv\CC^4\). We already know
from the book (see also <a href="#chapter-8-bloch-M-c">my calculations</a> above) that trace-preserving operations map this
space into an real-affine subspace of \(\CC^{2\times2}\). Fixing \(I\) as the origin of these
spaces the resulting mapping is real-affine-linear (not sure how to say it correctly).
</p>

<p>
It simplifies matters to consider the larger (four-dimensional) real <i>linear</i> (without the
<i>affine</i>) subspace \(S\) consisting of the following matrices:
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho = e + x X + y Y + z Z ,
\]
</p>

<p>
where \(e,x,y,z\in\RR\). Note that <i>any</i> matrix in \(\CC^{2\times2}\) can be written like that
but with <i>complex</i> coefficients (indeed: \(I,X,Y,Z\) is an ONB with respect to the scalar
product \(A,B\mapsto\trace{A^\dagger\?B}\)). In particular \(E\) can be written as
</p>

<p>
\[
  E = sI + uX + vY + wZ
\]
</p>

<p>
for \(s,u,v,w\in\CC\). Let us prove the following Lemma.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Lemma</dt><dd>Any quantum operation (trace-preserving or not) acts as a <i>real</i>-linear map
from \(S\) to itself.
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Proof</dt><dd><p>
Let us conveniently write \(\rho=(e,x,y,z)\) in the basis \((I,X,Y,Z)\). We have
</p>

<p>
\[
    X\rho Y = (-\ii z, y, x, \ii e) \text{ and } Y\rho X = (\ii z, y, x, -\ii e) .
    \]
</p>

<p>
Certainly you can see the pattern here and generalize it to the other two
Pauli-operator pairs. Moreover
</p>

<p>
\[
    X\rho X = (e, x, -y, -z) ,
    \]
</p>

<p>
and analogously for the other two Pauli-operators. Hence
</p>

<p>
\[ \rho\mapsto\?uX\rho\?u^*X = (\chi e, \chi x, -\chi y, -\chi z) \]
</p>

<p>
where \(\chi=\abs{u}^2\). Hence this type of transformation is <i>real</i>-linear. On the
other hand it is easy to see that
</p>

<p>
\[
    uX \rho v^*Y + vY \rho u^* X = (-\beta z, \alpha y, \alpha x, \beta e)
    \]
</p>

<p>
where \(\alpha=2\Re(u^*v)\) and \(\beta=\ii\?uv^*-\ii\?u^*v=2\Im(u^*v)\). Hence this
transformation is also real-linear. Observe that
</p>

<p>
\[
    E \rho E^\dagger
    \]
</p>

<p>
can be decomposed into a sum of transformations similar to the proceeding ones. Hence
it is real linear too. Since a quantum operation is a sum of such one-element
operations it follows that any quantum operation is real linear. QED.

</dl></dd>
</dl>


<p>
Clearly a map is trace-preserving if it maps the affine subspace described by \(e=1\) into
itself (works for any affine subspace defined by setting \(e\) to a non-zero
constant). Hence, we derived in a slightly different way the conclusion that
trace-preserving quantum operations correspond to mappings within the Bloch-space.
</p>

<p>
It would be interesting to <i>characterize</i> what maps are possible. I believe they are
characterized by \(\det(M)\geq0\) (where \(M:\RR^4\to\RR^4\) for the non-trace-preserving
maps). At least for single-element operations we can use sage to verify that the
determinant is always non-negative:
</p>

(s^2 - u^2 - v^2 - w^2)^2*(conjugate(s)^2 - conjugate(u)^2 - conjugate(v)^2 - conjugate(w)^2)^2
</pre>


<p>
So for \(\calE(\rho)=E\rho\?E^\dagger\) with an arbitrary \(E=s+uX+vY+wZ\) we have
</p>

<p>
\[
  \det(M) = \abs{s^2-u^2-v^2-w^2}^4 .
\]
</p>

<p>
In principle the most general operation can be constructed from four single operation
elements (see <a href="#exercise-8.10">exercise 8.10</a>). However the symbolic determinant as computed by <code>sage</code> is
too complicated to see a pattern (or to use <code>factor</code>).

We have seen in the first part of the solution that non-trace-preserving operation can at
least be interpreted in \(\RR^4\). I also conjectured that this representation has
non-negative determinant. For trace preserving operations this would imply that the
determinant with respect to \(\RR^3\) is also positive.
</p>

<p>
The following is an example for a non-trace-preserving operation with negative determinant
with respect to \(\RR^3\):
</p>

<p>
\[
  E_0 = I, \quad E_1 = X + \ii Y .
\]
</p>

<p>
Indeed, for \(\rho=(e,x,y,z)\) with respect to the Pauli basis \((I,X,Y,Z)\) (recall \(e=1\) for
density matrices) we have
</p>

<p>
\[
  \calE(\rho) = (3e-2z,x,y,2e-z) .
\]
</p>

<p>
The following sage code "proves" it:

<pre class="src src-sage"><span class="org-variable-name">E0</span> <span class="org-operator">=</span> Id

<p>
If we project this into the three dimensional Bloch-space the corresponding matrix is
\(\diag(1,1,-1)\), which has a negative determinant. Hence it cannot be represented as a
deformation of the Bloch sphere, followed by a rotation and a displacement. Otherwise the
determinant would be non-negative (as is the case in \(\RR^4\)).
