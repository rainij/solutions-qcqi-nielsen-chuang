This is a really basic question and it should actually be obvious <i>if</i> you really
understand the bra-ket notation (beware however that it might <i>appear</i> to be obvious if
you merely feel <i>familiar</i> with it).
</p>

<p>
To give a meaningful solution beyond "it is obvious" we take a step back and recall what
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation">bra-ket</a> notation actually means. In quantum mechanics we always work on (complex)
Hilbert spaces. A Hilbert space is a (complex) vector space \(\calH\) equipped with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesquilinear_form">sesquilinear form</a>, which has to obey certain axioms to be mentioned soon. We denote it by
</p>

<p>
\[
  (\ket{\psi}, \ket{\varphi}) .
\]
</p>

<p>
A sesquilinear form is a mapping \(\calH\times\calH\to\CC\) which is linear in the second
argument and conjugate-linear in the first argument. For a Hilbert space we require in
addition that (<b>positivity</b>)
</p>

<p>
\[
  \forall \ket{\psi} \in \calH\backslash\{0\}: \; (\ket{\psi}, \ket{\psi}) > 0 ,
\]
</p>

<p>
and that (<b>symmetry</b>)
</p>

<p>
\[
  \forall \ket{\psi}, \ket{\varphi} \in \calH : \; (\ket{\psi},\ket{\varphi})
  = \overline{(\ket{\varphi},\ket{\psi})} .
\]
</p>

<p>
(The bar means <i>complex conjugation</i>.) Such a sesquilinear form is called a <b>scalar
product</b>. This is what makes a complex <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space">Hilbert space</a></i>, a complex vector space equipped
with a scalar product. There are also real Hilbert spaces but we do not need them
here. Note that we are always talking about <i>finite</i> dimensional vector spaces. In case of
infinite dimensional vector spaces a <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_metric_space">completeness</a></b> axiom is required in addition. (In the
finite dimensional case this axiom follows automatically from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_of_the_real_numbers">completeness</a> axiom of
real (and hence complex) numbers).
</p>

<p>
In the framework of Dirac's bra-ket notation the kets are just the elements of the Hilbert
space. We already used this in the above introduction. The bras are elements of the <i>dual
space</i> \(\calH^*\) which is just the space of linear maps \(\calH\to\CC\). For any
\(\ket{\psi}\in\calH\) an example of such a map is given by
</p>

<p>
\[
  \ket{\varphi} \mapsto (\ket{\psi}, \ket{\varphi}) .
\]
</p>

<p>
<a id="org29e77bd"></a>
In fact, one can prove that any element of \(\calH^*\) (that is, any linear map
\(\calH\to\CC\)) can be written like this for a <i>unique</i> \(\ket{\psi}\). This is called the
<b>canonical isomorphism</b> between \(\calH\) and \(\calH^*\) (it is called <i>canonical</i> since we
could define it without knowing anything concrete about our Hilbert space, in other
words it is definable in the most abstract terms).
</p>

<p>
This canonical isomorphism actually motivates the bras. A bra \(\bra{\psi}\in\calH^*\) is
the linear map given by
</p>

<p>
\[
  \bra{\psi} : \; \ket{\varphi} \mapsto \sprod{\psi}{\varphi} := (\ket{\psi}, \ket{\varphi}) .
\]
</p>

<p>
Having said that, terms like
</p>

<p>
\[
  \bra{\psi} U \ket{\varphi}
\]
</p>

<p>
are the same as
</p>

<p>
\[
  \bra{\psi} U \ket{\varphi} = (\bra{\psi}\circ U) \ket{\varphi} = (\ket{\psi}, U\ket{\varphi}) ,
\]
</p>

<p>
where \(\circ\) denotes the composition of functions (\(U\) and \(\bra{\psi}\) as linear maps
are both functions of course). And of course, the bra-ket notation also makes the above
introduced notation for the scalar product obsolete since basically the bra and the ket
are the left and right half of the scalar product.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfb5166a" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orgfb5166a">The actual proof</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgfb5166a">
<p>
Let us return to the actual exercise. We use the above notation \((\ldots,\ldots)\) for the
scalar product to make the derivation clearer. Let \(U\) be a unitary operator on \(\calH\)
and let
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho = \rho_{\ket{\psi}} = \proj{\psi} .
\]
</p>

<p>
The task is to calculate \(\rho_{U\ket{\psi}}\) and to show that it is equal to
\(\calE(\rho_{\ket{\psi}})\). Note that \(\rho\) is a linear map \(\calH\to\calH\) given by
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho \ket{\varphi} = \ket{\psi} \sprod{\psi}{\varphi} = (\ket{\psi}, \ket{\varphi}) \ket{\varphi} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Hence
</p>

\begin{align*}
  \rho_{U\ket{\psi}} \ket{\varphi} &= (U\ket{\psi}, \ket{\varphi}) U\ket{\psi} \\
  &= (\ket{\psi}, U^\dagger\ket{\varphi}) U\ket{\psi} \\
  &= \bra{\psi} U^\dagger \ket{\varphi} U\ket{\psi} \\
  &= U\ket{\psi} \bra{\psi} U^\dagger \ket{\varphi} \\
  &= U\rho_{\ket{\psi}} U^\dagger \ket{\varphi} .
\end{align*}

<p>
The first equality follows from the definition of \(\rho_{\ket{\psi}}\). The second one
follows from the definition of the (hermitian) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_adjoint">adjoint</a> operator. The third one is the
definition of the bras. The fourth equality just moves the complex number
\(\bra{\psi}U\ket{\varphi}\) to the right. The last equation is again the definition of
\(\rho_{\ket{\psi}}\).
</p>

<p>
Since the above eqation holds for all \(\varphi\) we have
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho_{U\ket{\psi}} = U\rho_{\ket{\psi}} U^\dagger .
\]
</p>

<p>
QED.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Remark</dt><dd><p>
There is another slightly deeper way to see this result. Let us denote the
above mentioned <a href="#org29e77bd">canonical isomorphism</a> by
</p>

<p>
\[
  \iota(\ket{\psi}) = \bra{\psi} .
  \]
</p>

<p>
It is not hard to show that
</p>

<p>
\[
  \iota(U\ket{\psi}) = \iota(\ket{\psi}) U^\dagger = \bra{\psi} U^\dagger .
  \]
</p>

<p>
In fact, the proof is even shorter than the proof of the claim of the exercise. That is,
the <i>canonical</i> way to associate a linear mapping \(\calH^*\to\calH^*\) with \(U\) is the
right composition with \(U^\dagger\). From this the claim of the exercise follows too.

<h3 id="orgc17e5ec">Exercise 8.2 (Measurement as a quantum operation)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc17e5ec">
<p>
Recall from Section 2.2.3 (on page 84) that a quantum measurement with outcomes labeled by
\(m\) is described by a set of measurement operators \(M_m\) such that
\(\sum_mM_m^\dagger\,M_m=I\). Let the state of the system immediately before the measurement
be \(\rho\). Show that for \(\calE_m(\rho)=M_m\rho\,M_m^\dagger\), the state of the system
immediately after the measurement is
</p>

<p>
\[
  \frac{\calE_m(\rho)}{\trace{\calE_m(\rho)}} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Also show that the probability of obtaining this measurement result is
\(p(m)=\trace{\calE_m(\rho)}\).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9672ad3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org9672ad3">Solution</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9672ad3">
<p>
Clearly the exercise assumes that we only know the postulates of quantum mechanics for
<i>pure</i> states as detailed in section 2.2.3 and not the generalization to mixed states as
detailed in 2.4.1. Otherwise the exercise would be a trivial restatement of the evolution
and measurement postulates.
</p>

<p>
Let us first assume that \(\rho=\proj{\psi}\) is a pure state (just expressed as a density
matrix). In order to compute the trace of an operator \(\sigma\) we can take <i>any</i>
orthonormal basis \(\{e\}\) and have \(\trace{\sigma}=\sum_{e}\bra{e}\sigma\ket{e}\). Let
\(\sigma=\proj{\nu}\) with a not necessarily normalized non-zero \(\ket{\nu}\). Without loss
of generality we may assume that \(\ket{\nu}/\norm{\nu}\) is part of our chosen ONB (this
follows from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process">Gram-Schmidt</a> procedure). Hence
</p>

<p>
<a id="org75702e7"></a>
\[
  \trace{\sigma} = \sum_{e} \bra{e}\proj{\nu}\ket{e}
  = \sprod{\nu}{\nu} \sprod{\nu}{\nu} / \norm{\nu}^2
  = \norm{\nu}^2 .
\]
</p>

<p>
Given a state \(\ket{\psi}\) the post measurement state after measuring \(m\) is
\(M_m\ket{\psi}/\norm{M_m\ket{\psi}}\). From the reasoning in <a href="#exercise-8.1">exercise 1</a> (that \(U\) was a
unitary operator didn't really matter there) we deduce that the corresponding density
matrix is
</p>

<p>
\[
  \frac{M_m \rho M_m^\dagger}{\norm{M_m\ket{\psi}}^2} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Using <a href="#org75702e7">the equation</a> involving \(\sigma\) (with \(\ket{\nu}=M_m\ket{\psi}\)) we see that
\(\norm{M_m\ket{\psi}}^2=\trace{M_m\rho\,M_m^\dagger}\). Hence the post measurement state is
</p>

<p>
\[
  \frac{M_m \rho M_m^\dagger}{\trace{M_m\rho M_m^\dagger}} .
\]
</p>

<p>
The probability to measure \(m\) (and to obtain this state) is
</p>

<p>
\[
  p(m) = \norm{M_m\ket{\psi}}^2 = \trace{M_m \rho M_m^\dagger} .
\]
</p>

<p>
This concludes the exercise for pure states. Let \(\rho\) be a mixed state now. This means
that there is a decomposition
</p>

<p>
\[
  \rho = \sum_j p_j \proj{\psi_j}
\]
</p>

<p>
with strictly positive coefficients \(p_j\) such that \(\sum_jp_j=1\). The ensemble
interpretation says that having such a mixed state means that, upon measurement, one of
the pure states \(\ket{\psi_j}\) is taken at random with probability \(p_j\) and then the
measurement proceeds as in the pure state case. It is not a-priori clear that this is well
defined since the decomposition of \(\rho\) into pure states is not unique (c.f. Theorem 2.6
on page 103). But let us ignore this for the moment. We will see that the obtained
probabilities and the post measurement states are independent of the concrete
decomposition, hence the problem solves itself.
</p>

<p>
According to the ensemble interpretation the probability to measure \(m\) is
</p>

<p>
\[
  p(m) = \sum_j p(m|j) \, p_j = \sum_j \trace{M_m\proj{\psi_j} M_m^\dagger} \, p_j
  = \trace{M_m \rho M_m^\dagger} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Here
</p>

<p>
\[
  p(m|j) = \norm{M_m \ket{\psi_j}}^2 = \trace{M_m \proj{\psi_j} M_m^\dagger}
\]
</p>

<p>
is the conditioned probability to measure \(m\) if we already know that the pure state
\(\psi_j\) was chosen. Suppose we know that we measured \(m\). What is the (mixed) state in
that case? We already know that with (conditioned) probability \(p(j|m)\) the post
measurement state is
</p>

<p>
\[
  \frac{M_m\proj{\psi_j} M_m^\dagger}{p(m|j)} .
\]
</p>

<p>
But this is an ensemble of pure states! Hence, using \(p(m|j)p_j=p(m\cap\,j)=p(j|m)p(m)\),
the corresponding mixed state is
</p>

<p>
\[
  \sum_j p(j|m) \frac{M_m\proj{\psi_j} M_m^\dagger}{p(m|j)}
  = \frac{1}{p(m)} \sum_j p_j M_m\proj{\psi_j} M_m^\dagger
  = \frac{M_m\rho M_m^\dagger}{p(m)}
  = \frac{M_m\rho M_m^\dagger}{\trace{M_m\rho M_m^\dagger}} .
\]
</p>

<p>
This concludes the exercise. But let is briefly mention that in case we do <i>not</i> obtain
the outcome of the measurement the post measurement state is
</p>

<p>
<a id="org4dd03de"></a>
\[
  \sum_{m,j} p(m|j) p_j \, \frac{M_m \proj{\psi_j} M_m^\dagger}{p(m|j)}
  = \sum_m M_m \rho M_m^\dagger .
\]
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Remark</dt><dd><p>
Together with the conclusions from the actual exercise we can draw the
following additional conclusion: If now we somehow obtain the measurement result than
<a href="#org4dd03de">this sum</a> "collapses" into one of its summands (just normalized), with probability
\(\trace{M_m\rho\,M_m^\dagger}\) for each of them. That is, the measurement can be
decomposed into two parts: First the state changes to
</p>

<p>
\[
    \calE(\rho) = \sum_m \calE_m(\rho)
  \]
</p>

<p>
and then (if we obtain the measurement result) the state "collapses" into
\(\calE_m(\rho)/\trace{\calE_m(\rho)}\) for one of the \(m\) with probability
\(\trace{\calE_m(\rho)}\). So, the first part of the measurement can be expressed in terms
of quantum operations. But not the second part (since it is not deterministic and cannot
give rise to a mathematical function on density matrices).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbde7759">
<p>
Our derivation of the operator-sum representation implicitly assumed that the input and
output spaces for the operation were the same. Suppose a composite system AB initially in
an unknown quantum state \(\rho\) is brought into contact with a composite system CD initially in
some standard state \(\ket{0}\), and the two systems interact according to a unitary interaction
\(U\). After the interaction we discard systems A and D, leaving a state \(\rho'\) of system
BC. Show that the map \(\calE(\rho)=\rho'\) satisfies
</p>

<p>
\[
  \calE(\rho) = \sum_k E_k \rho E_k^\dagger ,
\]
</p>

<p>
for some set of linear operators \(E_k\) from the state space of system AB to the state
space of system BC, and such that \(\sum_kE_k^\dagger\,E_k\).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org52ea347" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org52ea347">Proof</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org52ea347">
<p>
Basically we do the same as the book for the special case of equal input and output
space. According to the exercise we have
</p>

<p>
\[
  \calE(\rho) = \ptrace{AD}{U \rho \otimes \proj{0} U^\dagger} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Let \(\{e_k\}\) be an orthonormal basis of AD. Hence
</p>

<p>
\[
  \calE(\rho) = \sum_k \bra{e_k} U \rho \otimes \proj{0} U^\dagger \ket{e_k} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Thus, defining \(E_k=\bra{e_k}U\ket{0}\), we have
</p>

<p>
\[
  \calE(\rho) = \sum_k E_k \rho E_k^\dagger .
\]
</p>

<p>
That is, \(\calE\) has the required form. We only have to show the completeness property
\(J:=\sum_kE_k^\dagger\,E_k=I_{AB}\). Note that \(J=J^\dagger\) is self-adjoint and
positive-definite. Let \(\rho\) be arbitrary and consider
</p>

<p>
\[
  1 = \ptrace{BC}{\calE(\rho)} = \sum_k \ptrace{BC}{E_k\rho E_k^\dagger}
  = \sum_k \ptrace{AB}{E_k^\dagger E_k \rho}
  = \ptrace{AB}{J^\dagger \rho} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Here we used the well-known <i>cyclicity property</i> of the trace (which also holds for
(matching) rectangular matrices). Thus
</p>

<p>
<a id="org2f51533"></a>
\[
  \forall \rho : \; \trace{(J-I)^\dagger \rho} = 0 .
\]
</p>

<p>
Here the quantification runs over all density operators (hermitian, positive definite,
trace 1).
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Remark</dt><dd>In case you wonder why I take the adjoint of \(J\). We have that
\(S,T\mapsto\trace{S^\dagger\,T}\) turns the matrix space \(\CC^{n\times\?n}\) into a
complex Hilbert space. See e.g. the definition of a Hilbert-Schmidt operator on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%E2%80%93Schmidt_operator">wikipedia</a> (it is about infinite dimensional spaces but just note that in finite
dimensions every operator is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator). For this exercise it does not
directly help us since the quantification <a href="#org2f51533">above</a> is <i>not</i> over all
\(\rho\in\CC^{n\times\?n}\). But still nice to know 😉.</dd>

<p>
Considering all rank-1 density matrices \(\rho=\proj{\psi}\) we deduce
</p>

<p>
\[
  \forall \ket{\psi} : \; \trace{(J-I)^\dagger \proj{\psi}} = \bra{\psi} (J-I)^\dagger \ket{\psi} = 0 .
\]
</p>

<p>
(The first equality can either be seen by the cyclicity property of the trace or by using
an ONB which involves \(\psi\) (but normalized) as one of its elements) But this can only be
true (for all normalized \(\ket{\psi}\)) if \(J=I\). QED.

where \(X\) is the usual Pauli matrix (acting on the environment), and \(P_0\equiv\proj{0}\),

<h4 id="org49c8cb6">Solution</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org49c8cb6">
<p>
Note that \(U\) is nothing else than the <code>CNOT</code> gate. Let us label the environment by E. One
way to define the operation elements is
</p>

\begin{align*}
  E_0 &= \bra{0_E} U \ket{0_E} = P_0 \sprod{0_E}{0_E} + P_1 \bra{0_E}X\ket{0_E} = P_0 , \\
  E_1 &= \bra{1_E} U \ket{0_E} = P_0 \sprod{1_E}{0_E} + P_1 \bra{1_E}X\ket{0_E} = P_1 .
\end{align*}

<p>
(The \(\ket{0_E}\) to the right of \(U\) comes from the initial state of the environment.)
Hence
</p>

<p>
\[
  \calE(\rho) = P_0 \rho P_0 + P_1 \rho P_1 = \begin{bmatrix} \rho_{00} & 0 \\ 0 & \rho_{11} \end{bmatrix} .
\]
</p>

<p>
That is, this operation acts like the first part of a measurement. It describes the state
after a measurement in the Z-basis if nobody tells us the measurement outcome. Once we get
the outcome the state "collapses" to one of the two summands (properly normalized of
course). The respective probabilities are \(\rho_{00}\) (for outcome \(0\)) and \(\rho_{11}\)
(for outcome \(1\)).

<h4 id="orgd0a5e82">Solution</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd0a5e82">
<p>
First of all let us make sure that \(U\) really is unitary. We have \(U^\dagger=U\), hence
</p>

<p>
\[
  U^\dagger U = U^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( X^2 \otimes I + Y^2 \otimes X^2 + (XY+YX)\otimes X \right) = I .
\]
</p>

<p>
Hence \(U\) is indeed unitary. One way to define the operation elements is as follows:
</p>

\begin{align*}
  E_0 &= \bra{0_E} U \ket{0_E} = X \sprod{0_E}{0_E} + Y \bra{0_E}X\ket{0_E} = X , \\
  E_1 &= \bra{1_E} U \ket{0_E} = X \sprod{1_E}{0_E} + Y \bra{1_E}X\ket{0_E} = Y .
\end{align*}

<p>
Hence
</p>

<p>
\[
  \calE(\rho) = \frac{1}{2} \left(X \rho X + Y \rho Y \right)
  = \begin{bmatrix} \rho_{11} & 0 \\ 0 & \rho_{00} \end{bmatrix} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Interpreting this in the same way as in <a href="#exercise-8.4">exercise 8.4</a> we deduce that \(\calE\) corresponds to
a spin-flip followed by a measurement (without obtaining the measurement outcome).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org37093e8">
<p>
Suppose \(\calE\) and \(\calF\) are quantum operations on the same quantum system. Show that
the composition \(\calF\circ\calE\) is a quantum operation, in the sense that it has an
operator-sum representation. State and prove an extension of this result to the case where
\(\calE\) and \(\calF\) do not necessarily have the same input and output spaces.

<div id="outline-container-org06b2914" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org06b2914">Proof</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org06b2914">
<p>
Suppose
</p>

\begin{align*}
  \calE(\rho) &= \sum_i E_i \rho E_i^\dagger , \\

<p>
Then
</p>

\begin{align*}
  \calF \circ \calE(\rho) = \sum_{ij} F_j E_i \rho E_i^\dagger F_j^\dagger .
\end{align*}

<p>
This suggests to use all the \(F_jE_i\) as operation elements of the composition. That
\(\calF\circ\calE\) is indeed a quantum operation now follows from
</p>

<p>
\[
  \sum_{ij} E_i^\dagger F_j^\dagger F_j E_i = \sum_i E_i^\dagger E_i = I .

The proof directly generalizes (without any change) to the case where \(\calE:A\to\?B\) and
\(\calF:B\to\?C\). QED.

Let \(\sigma=\sum_jq_j\proj{j}\) be the state of the environment E. The generalized

\[
  E_\infty = \sqrt{I - \sum_k E_k^\dagger E_k} .

<h3 id="org926616c">Exercise 8.9 (Measurement model)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org926616c">
<p>
If we are given a set of quantum operations \(\{\calE_m\}\) such that \(\sum_m\calE_m\) is
trace-preserving, then it is possible to construct a measurement model giving rise to this
set of quantum operations. For each \(m\), let \(E_{mk}\) be a set of operation elements for
\(\calE_m\). Introduce an environmental system, E, with an orthonormal basis \(\ket{m,k}\) in
one-to-one correspondence with the set of indices for the operation elements. Analogously
to the earlier construction, define an operator \(U\) such that
</p>

<p>
\[
  U \ket{\psi} \ket{e_0} = \sum_{mk} E_{mk} \ket{\psi} \ket{m,k} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Next, deﬁne projectors \(P_m=\sum_k\proj{m,k}\) on the environmental system, E.  Show that
performing \(U\) on \(\rho\otimes\proj{e_0}\), then measuring \(P_m\) gives \(m\) with probability
\(\trace{\calE_m(\rho)}\), and the corresponding post-measurement state of the principal
system is \(\calE_m(\rho)/\trace{\calE_m(\rho)}\).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf91bb3d" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf91bb3d">Solution</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf91bb3d">
<p>
That \(U\) can be extended to a unitary operator can be seen as in the other cases of
constructing an environment model. We have
</p>

\begin{align*}
  \ptrace{E}{P_m U \rho \otimes \proj{e_0} U^\dagger P_m}
  &= \ptrace{E}{\sum_{m,k,l} E_{mk}\rho E_{ml}^\dagger \otimes \ket{m,k}\bra{m,l}} \\
  &= \sum_{m,k} E_{mk}\rho E_{mk}^\dagger \\
  &= \calE_m(\rho) .
\end{align*}

<p>
Hence, using \(\trace{\ptrace{E}{\ldots}}=\trace{\ldots}\), the probability to measure \(m\)
after applying \(U\) to \(\rho\otimes\proj{e_0}\) is
</p>

<p>
\[
  p(m) = \trace{P_m U \rho \otimes \proj{e_0} U^\dagger P_m} = \trace{\calE_m(\rho)} .
\]
</p>

<p>
The post-measurement state of the whole system is
</p>

<p>
\[
  \frac{P_m U \rho \otimes \proj{e_0} U^\dagger P_m}{p(m)} .
\]
</p>

<p>
Taking the partial trace of the environment yields the post-measurement state of the
principal system
</p>

<p>
\[
  \frac{\ptrace{E}{P_m U \rho \otimes \proj{e_0} U^\dagger P_m}}{p(m)}
  = \frac{\calE_m(\rho)}{\trace{\calE_m(\rho)}} .
